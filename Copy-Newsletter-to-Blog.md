## Procedure for copying the Python for Microcontrollers Newsletter from Adafruit Daily to an ICYMI post on blogs.adafruit.com

1.	A good template for looking at the final result is looking at the previous weeks’ post on blog.adafruit.com

2.	Copy all the image files to the Adafruit Blog Wordpress Media area

3.	Go to https://www.adafruitdaily.com/category/circuitpython/ in a browser and find the latest adafruitdaily blog entry and click on it.
4.	Use the browser View Source

5.	Copy all the HTML from the newsletter heading to the end paragraph about contributing. The HTML before and after that is not needed and should not be used.

6.	Paste the HTML into an editor with search/replace

7.	Search for cdn-daily-blog.adafruitdaily.com and replace with cdn-blog.adafruit.com

8.	Copy all the text

9.	Open Wordpress and click on the **Text** tab

10.	Paste the changed HTML into Wordpress 

11.	Click the **Visual** tab and the newsletter should appear. The pictures should be in there as long as they were copied with their same file names into the Wordpress Media section and the URLs were changed.

12.	The “Click this link to open this email in a browser”, if at the top of the text should be deleted.

13.	Title the newsletter the same as the title of the adafruitdaily newsletter complete with social media tags.
