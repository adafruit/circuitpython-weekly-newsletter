## Python Becomes the #1 Programming Language via TIOBE

[![Python #1](../assets/20211012/20211012tiobe.jpg)](https://www.tiobe.com/tiobe-index/)

For the first time in more than 20 years, the TIOBE programming language index a new leader of the pack: the Python programming language. The long-standing hegemony of Java and C is over. Python, which started as a simple scripting language, as an alternative to Perl, has become mature. Its ease of learning, its huge amount of libraries, and its widespread use in all kinds of domains, has made it the most popular programming language of today. Congratulations Guido van Rossum and the many contributors to the Python ecosystem! - [TIOBE](https://www.tiobe.com/tiobe-index/).

## CircuitPython Project Bundle

[![BundleFly](../assets/20211012/20211012bundlefly.jpg)](https://learn.adafruit.com/)

When you get to the CircuitPython code section of an [Adafruit Learn Guide](https://learn.adafruit.com/), sometimes things can get a bit complicated. You not only have the code you need to upload to your device, but you likely also need to add some libraries that the code requires to run. This involved downloading all the libraries, digging through to find the ones you need, and copying them to your device. That was only the beginning on some projects, as those that include images and/or sound files required further downloading and copying of files. But, not anymore!

Now, with Project Bundles, you can download all the necessary code, libraries and, if needed, asset files with one click! We automatically check which libraries are required for the project and bundle them up for you. No more digging through a huge list of libraries to find the ones you need, or fiddling with looking for other files or dependencies. Download the Project Bundle, copy the contents to your device, and your code will simply work. We wanted to make this the easiest way to get a project working, regardless of whether you're a beginner or an expert. We'll also be adding this feature to popular IDEs as an add-on. Try it out with any Circuit Python guide on the Adafruit Learning System. Just look for the ‘Download Project Bundle’ button on the code page. 

**To download and use a Project Bundle:**

In the Learning System - above any embedded code in a guide in the Adafruit Learn System, you’ll find a Download Project Bundle button.

[![Project Bundle download button](../assets/20211012/20211012pblink.jpg)](https://learn.adafruit.com/)

Click the button to download the Project Bundle zip.

[![Project Bundle zip downloaded](../assets/20211012/20211012pbzipfile.jpg)](https://learn.adafruit.com/)

Open the Project Bundle zip to find the example code, all necessary libraries, and, if available, any images, sounds, etc.

[![Project Bundle unzipped](../assets/20211012/20211012pbdownload.jpg)](https://learn.adafruit.com/)

Simply copy all the files over to your CIRCUITPY drive, and you’re ready to go!

If you run into any problems or bugs, or would like to submit feedback, please file an issue on the [Adafruit Learning System Guides GitHub repo](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_Learning_System_Guides/issues).

## CircuitPython Libraries!

[![CircuitPython Libraries](../assets/20211012/blinka.png)](https://circuitpython.org/libraries)

## What’s the team up to this week?

What is the team up to this week? Let’s check in!

**Dan**

I have been working on "boot keyboard" support for USB HID. BIOSes and similar pre-boot software in the past did not have the code space to support general USB HID keyboards and mice. Instead, the USB standard allows that software to request that the keyboard or mouse use a standardized description. I implemented this in CircuitPython, but it did not work quite right. Ha Thach helped me discover that the BIOSes want the rest of the USB description to be even simpler as well. I will try that out. This also gave me an idea about how to simplify the Adafruit Windows 7/8.1 driver package so it works more like Windows 10, and we don't have to keep adding new boards to it. we'll see whether it works.

I have been going through some issues we want to fix for the next 7.x release. Most have been simple. A number of built-in modules were not allowing keywords to be used for required arguments: I've fixed that.

**Jeff**

It's a new month, I guess that means it's time to implement a library for another camera module in CircuitPython. This time it's the OV5640, a module with a 5 megapixel sensor. I made a short video about it, which you can catch [on the Adafrut Blog](https://blog.adafruit.com/2021/10/06/coming-up-ov5640-camera-on-esp32-s2-with-circuitpython-esp32-circuitpython-adafruit/). As the video says, we'll add the library to the Bundle when it's mature.

**Kattni**

This week I published the [ANO Directional Navigation and Scroll Wheel Rotary Encoder and Breakout guide](https://learn.adafruit.com/ano-rotary-encoder). It has everything you need to get started with your ANO rotary encoder and accompanying breakout including an overview, pinouts, downloads resources and examples in both CircuitPython and Arduino.

Next up is a guide for the new EyeLights LED Glasses Driver and Panel. It's already chock full of all kinds of details and examples for these boards, and there's still more to come. Keep an eye out for that guide coming soon!

**Melissa**

This past week, I dove back into JavaScript and updated the JavaScript version of the Bluetooth File Transfer library to include the remaining functions the the CircuitPython version had. The next step is to make use of those new functions and supercharge the CircuitPython Code Editor at https://code.circuitpython.org/.

**Scott**

At the end of last week I setup the [broadcom-peripherals](https://github.com/adafruit/broadcom-peripherals) repository for storing the lowest level bits for treating the broadcom chips on Raspberry Pis as bare metal microcontrollers rather than complex application processors. This repository includes system view description (SVD) files describing the register layout of peripherals. These files can then be loaded into GDB for debugging and be used to generate C headers. The low level C functions are then built on top of the generated C headers.

After I got this going I generated info for the VideoCore Mailbox which is how the ARM cores communicate to the VideoCore GPU. Through this mailbox I ask the GPU to enable power to USB and then TinyUSB can start up the USB peripheral.

Next, I'm working on connecting up the peripheral interrupts. These are needed to tell TinyUSB that something has happened on the USB bus so TinyUSB can respond. (It also does many other signals.)

Lastly, I assembled my debug hat that makes it easier to debug the pi itself. The board has four LEDs that have the signals out on pins, UART pin out, "SWD" form of JTAG, regular JTAG and a Stemma QT connector. Check out the board at [OSH Park](https://oshpark.com/shared_projects/fBq76nP9).
