## Nicholas Tollervey and Fabio Pliger Give an Update on PyScript

[![TalkPython podcast](../assets/20230814/20230814ps.jpg)](https://talkpython.fm/episodes/show/426/whats-new-in-pyscript-august-2023)

One of the most exciting initiatives in the Python space these days is PyScript, which enables Python running natively in a browser. With consistent support from the folks at Anaconda, this project has been making solid strides since its initial release. On the latest episode of TalkPython, host Michael Kennedy catches up with Fabio Pliger and Nicholas Tollervey to see where they are with the PyScript project. - [TalkPython](https://talkpython.fm/episodes/show/426/whats-new-in-pyscript-august-2023).

## Interesting Books This Week

[![Books This Week](../assets/20230814/20230814books.jpg)](https://jtemporal.com/gitmicrobook/)

Here are a couple useful books seen this week:

The Big Git Microbook is a quick guide to commands you will use daily. A book where you could find a description of how the most commonly used commands work, with practical examples? This microbook is an introduction to the fundamental concepts and commands of Git, a version control system widely used by software developers.
Throughout this book, you will have the chance to practice concepts and commands through real-world examples - [Jessica Temporal](https://jtemporal.com/gitmicrobook/).

Knowing the RP2040, A Guide for Programmers has you learn all the details of the RP2040 microprocessor (used in the Raspberry Pi Pico and other RP2040 boards) and how to leverage them in amazing applications - [Leanpub](https://leanpub.com/rp2040).

## This Week's Python Streams

[![Python Streams](../assets/20230814/cccircuitpython.jpg)](https://circuitpython.org/)

## New Boards Supported by CircuitPython

The number of supported microcontrollers and Single Board Computers (SBC) grows every week. This section outlines which boards have been included in CircuitPython or added to [CircuitPython.org](https://circuitpython.org/).

This week, there were (#/no) new boards added!

- [Board name](url)
- [Board name](url)
- [Board name](url)

*Note: For non-Adafruit boards, please use the support forums of the board manufacturer for assistance, as Adafruit does not have the hardware to assist in troubleshooting.*

Looking to add a new board to CircuitPython? It's highly encouraged! Adafruit has four guides to help you do so:

- [How to Add a New Board to CircuitPython](https://learn.adafruit.com/how-to-add-a-new-board-to-circuitpython/overview)
