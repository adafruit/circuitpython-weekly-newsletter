## New Boards Supported by CircuitPython

The number of supported microcontrollers and Single Board Computers (SBC) grows every week. This section outlines which boards have been included in CircuitPython or added to [CircuitPython.org](https://circuitpython.org/).

This week, there were (#/no) new boards added:

- [Board name](url)
- [Board name](url)
- [Board name](url)

*Note: For non-Adafruit boards, please use the support forums of the board manufacturer for assistance, as Adafruit does not have the hardware to assist in troubleshooting.*

Looking to add a new board to CircuitPython? It's highly encouraged! Adafruit has four guides to help you do so:

- [How to Add a New Board to CircuitPython](https://learn.adafruit.com/how-to-add-a-new-board-to-circuitpython/overview)
- [How to add a New Board to the circuitpython.org website](https://learn.adafruit.com/how-to-add-a-new-board-to-the-circuitpython-org-website)

## CircuitPython Libraries

[![CircuitPython Libraries](../assets/20240205/blinka.png)](https://circuitpython.org/libraries)

The CircuitPython library numbers are continually increasing, while existing ones continue to be updated. Here we provide library numbers and updates!

To get the latest Adafruit libraries, download the [Adafruit CircuitPython Library Bundle](https://circuitpython.org/libraries). To get the latest community contributed libraries, download the [CircuitPython Community Bundle](https://circuitpython.org/libraries).

If you'd like to contribute to the CircuitPython project on the Python side of things, the libraries are a great place to start. Check out the [CircuitPython.org Contributing page](https://circuitpython.org/contributing). If you're interested in reviewing, check out Open Pull Requests. If you'd like to contribute code or documentation, check out Open Issues. We have a guide on [contributing to CircuitPython with Git and GitHub](https://learn.adafruit.com/contribute-to-circuitpython-with-git-and-github), and you can find us in the #help-with-circuitpython and #circuitpython-dev channels on the [Adafruit Discord](https://adafru.it/discord).

You can check out this [list of all the Adafruit CircuitPython libraries and drivers available](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_Bundle/blob/master/circuitpython_library_list.md).

**Library PyPI Weekly Download Stats**



## What’s the CircuitPython team up to this week?

What is the team up to this week? Let’s check in:

**Melissa**

This past week, I finally wrapped up my fixes for the displays which now run on Bookworm. This includes creating my first pull request to Raspberry Pi Linux to fix up some of the device tree overlays and add additional functionality, which has been merged in. It should be part of the next release of Bookworm and once it is, we can simplify the installer scripts. With the displays now working, I'm going through and testing and updating the learn guides which we had to add warnings to when Bookworm was initially released.

**Tim**

This week I tested a handful of PRs for MiniMQTT and Wiznet5k libraries. I've also begun working on a project for an upcoming guide that is a small text editor cyberdeck built from the Feather RP2040 USB Host and a TFT Feathering. I started with a project that Jeff published a few months back and have added a visible cursor to it that is drawn with `displayio` on the display so it can be seen there in addition to the serial console. Next up is getting the keyboard input working into the USB Host feather.

**Jeff**

I added an example in `Adafruit_CircuitPython_PyCamera` of all the features of the new `bitmapfilter` module, which was released as part of 9.0.0-beta.0 last week.

Well, almost all the features of `bitmapfilter`, because this week I also added support for "blend functions", similar to the layer blend functions in photo editing programs. There's one base function coded in C to perform a blend, while the mathematics of each specific blend mode are specified as Python functions (many are quite simple). Applying a blend function on a pair of 208x208 pixel images takes about 20ms on an ESP32-S3.

This code will be in the next beta, and the Memento PyCamera filter example has already been updated to show some blending modes.

**Scott**

A number of [fixes I made](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aclosed+author%3Atannewt) for CircuitPython 9.0.0 were merged this past week. I'm really trying to push us to where 9.0.0 is stable.

The SD card over BLE and WiFi work was merged and folks have been hitting the behavior change of `storage.mount()`. With 9.0.0 you'll need to make a directory where you want to mount another file system. So, for example, you'll need to make a `sd` directory on the CIRCUITPY drive in order to mount to `/sd` from CircuitPython code.

Lastly, I've wrapped up #CircuitPython2024 this week. Thanks to [everyone who posted their ideas](https://blog.adafruit.com/tag/circuitpython2024/).

**Liz**

This past week I worked on the [CAN Bus BFF guide](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-can-bus-bff). This breakout lets you use CAN Bus with a QT Py form factor board. I've worked on a few CAN Bus products in the past year and this guide features a nice demo written by Ladyada that sends CAN messages every time you rotate a rotary encoder.
