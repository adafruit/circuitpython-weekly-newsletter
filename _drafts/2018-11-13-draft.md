Some GitHub news - "GitHub says it now hosts over 100M repositories and supports 31M developers, who collectively have created over 1.1B contributions. For context, GitHub had 33 million repositories when the company was founded in 2008, and nearly one in three repositories were made within the past year." - [Venturebeat.](https://venturebeat.com/2018/11/08/github-passes-100-million-repositories/)

## Made with Mu

Ben is working on something [pretty interesting](https://github.com/mu-editor/mu/issues/698) ... "I'm working with @flexiondotorg and @waveform80 on publishing a [snap](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snappy_(package_manager)) for [Mu](https://codewith.mu/), which will make it easy to install Mu across Linux distributions and potentially Windows and Mac in future. When a snap is published in the [snapcraft store](https://snapcraft.io/), Mu will be installable with snap install mu-editor and will bundle all dependencies, including Python, QT and all python libs. We will introduce a snapcraft.yml into the root of the project. This will contain the spec for how the snap is built." - via [Twitter.](https://twitter.com/ben_nuttall/status/1059956595549970432)

## Updated Guides - Now With More Python!

**You can use CircuitPython on Raspberry Pi!** We're updating all of our CircuitPython guides to show how to wire up sensors to your Raspberry Pi, and load the necessary CircuitPython libraries to get going using them with Python. We'll be including the updates here so you can easily keep track of which sensors are ready to go. Check it out!

## CircuitPython Libraries!

[![CircuitPython Libraries]({{ "/assets/22_1023blinka.png" | absolute_url }}){:width="418px"}](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_Bundle/releases/latest)

CircuitPython support for hardware continues to grow. We are adding support for new sensors and breakouts all the time, as well as improving on the drivers we already have. As we add more libraries and update current ones, you can keep up with all the changes right here!

For the latest drivers, download the [Adafruit CircuitPython Library Bundle](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_Bundle/releases/latest).

If you'd like to contribute, CircuitPython libraries are a great place to start. Have an idea for a new driver? File an issue on [CircuitPython](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/issues)! Interested in helping with current libraries? Check out [this GitHub issue on CircuitPython](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/issues/1246) for an overview of the State of the CircuitPython Libraries, updated each week. We've included open issues from the library issue lists, and details about repo-level issues that need to be addressed. We have a guide on [contributing to CircuitPython with Git and Github](https://learn.adafruit.com/contribute-to-circuitpython-with-git-and-github) if you need help getting started. You can also find us in the #circuitpython channel on the [Adafruit Discord](https://adafru.it/discord). Feel free to contact Kattni (@kattni) with any questions.

You can check out this [list of all the CircuitPython libraries and drivers available](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_Bundle/blob/master/circuitpython_library_list.md). 

The current number of CircuitPython libraries is **112**!
