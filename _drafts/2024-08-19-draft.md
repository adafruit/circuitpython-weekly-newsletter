## New Boards Supported by CircuitPython

The number of supported microcontrollers and Single Board Computers (SBC) grows every week. This section outlines which boards have been included in CircuitPython or added to [CircuitPython.org](https://circuitpython.org/).

This week, there were (#/no) new boards added:

- [Board name](url)
- [Board name](url)
- [Board name](url)

*Note: For non-Adafruit boards, please use the support forums of the board manufacturer for assistance, as Adafruit does not have the hardware to assist in troubleshooting.*

Looking to add a new board to CircuitPython? It's highly encouraged! Adafruit has four guides to help you do so:

- [How to Add a New Board to CircuitPython](https://learn.adafruit.com/how-to-add-a-new-board-to-circuitpython/overview)
- [How to add a New Board to the circuitpython.org website](https://learn.adafruit.com/how-to-add-a-new-board-to-the-circuitpython-org-website)

## CircuitPython Libraries

[![CircuitPython Libraries](../assets/20240819/blinka.png)](https://circuitpython.org/libraries)

The CircuitPython library numbers are continually increasing, while existing ones continue to be updated. Here we provide library numbers and updates!

To get the latest Adafruit libraries, download the [Adafruit CircuitPython Library Bundle](https://circuitpython.org/libraries). To get the latest community contributed libraries, download the [CircuitPython Community Bundle](https://circuitpython.org/libraries).

If you'd like to contribute to the CircuitPython project on the Python side of things, the libraries are a great place to start. Check out the [CircuitPython.org Contributing page](https://circuitpython.org/contributing). If you're interested in reviewing, check out Open Pull Requests. If you'd like to contribute code or documentation, check out Open Issues. We have a guide on [contributing to CircuitPython with Git and GitHub](https://learn.adafruit.com/contribute-to-circuitpython-with-git-and-github), and you can find us in the #help-with-circuitpython and #circuitpython-dev channels on the [Adafruit Discord](https://adafru.it/discord).

You can check out this [list of all the Adafruit CircuitPython libraries and drivers available](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_Bundle/blob/master/circuitpython_library_list.md). 

The current number of CircuitPython libraries is **###**!

## What’s the CircuitPython team up to this week?

What is the team up to this week? Let’s check in:

**Dan**

I was on vacation for part of last week and the week before. I'm continuing the MicroPython merges into CircuitPython.

**Melissa**

This past week, I mostly focused on writing, recording, and editing my CircuitPython Day video. It goes over many of the challenges I faced while working on the CircuitPython Code Editor and how I overcame those.

**Tim**

[![Tim](../assets/20240819/20240819tim.jpg)](https://www.circuitpython.org/)

text.

**Scott**

This last week has mostly been RP2350 work. I've enabled RGBMatrix and PIO based USB host, fixed audio output crashing and added a couple more boards. I also fixed a crash on startup on ESP32-S3. Next I'm going to try updating to ESP-IDF 5.3 for our CircuitPython 9.2.0 release.

**Liz**

I'm back this week from vacation. If you're ever in Portland, ME be sure to check out the [International Cryptozoology Museum](https://cryptozoologymuseum.com/). It's a really fun and weird spot.

As I've been catching up, I've been prepping for CircuitPython day. I've helped some folks pre-record their sessions and I think it's going to be a great day full of CircuitPython content.

Before I left on break, I worked on two projects to countdown to CircuitPython day. The first uses a [Feather ESP32-S3 TFT](https://learn.adafruit.com/feather-esp32-s3-tft-circuitpython-day-2024-countdown-clock) to display scrolling text for the countdown on top of the snazzy CircuitPython Day 2024 graphic. The Feather gets time using NTP over WiFi. The second project uses the [RP2040 Feather DVI with an Adalogger FeatherWing](https://learn.adafruit.com/feather-rp2040-dvi-circuitpython-day-2024-countdown-clock) to keep time offline and display the countdown over DVI. We have done quite a few countdown projects over the years, so I tried to come up with some new hardware combinations with these projects.

## Upcoming Events
