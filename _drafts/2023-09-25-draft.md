## New Boards Supported by CircuitPython

The number of supported microcontrollers and Single Board Computers (SBC) grows every week. This section outlines which boards have been included in CircuitPython or added to [CircuitPython.org](https://circuitpython.org/).

This week, there were (#/no) new boards added!

- [Board name](url)
- [Board name](url)
- [Board name](url)

*Note: For non-Adafruit boards, please use the support forums of the board manufacturer for assistance, as Adafruit does not have the hardware to assist in troubleshooting.*

Looking to add a new board to CircuitPython? It's highly encouraged! Adafruit has four guides to help you do so:

- [How to Add a New Board to CircuitPython](https://learn.adafruit.com/how-to-add-a-new-board-to-circuitpython/overview)
- [How to add a New Board to the circuitpython.org website](https://learn.adafruit.com/how-to-add-a-new-board-to-the-circuitpython-org-website)
- [Adding a Single Board Computer to PlatformDetect for Blinka](https://learn.adafruit.com/adding-a-single-board-computer-to-platformdetect-for-blinka)

## CircuitPython Libraries!

[![CircuitPython Libraries](../assets/20230925/blinka.png)](https://circuitpython.org/libraries)

The CircuitPython library numbers are continually increasing, while existing ones continue to be updated. Here we provide library numbers and updates!

To get the latest Adafruit libraries, download the [Adafruit CircuitPython Library Bundle](https://circuitpython.org/libraries). To get the latest community contributed libraries, download the [CircuitPython Community Bundle](https://circuitpython.org/libraries).

If you'd like to contribute to the CircuitPython project on the Python side of things, the libraries are a great place to start. Check out the [CircuitPython.org Contributing page](https://circuitpython.org/contributing). If you're interested in reviewing, check out Open Pull Requests. If you'd like to contribute code or documentation, check out Open Issues. We have a guide on [contributing to CircuitPython with Git and GitHub](https://learn.adafruit.com/contribute-to-circuitpython-with-git-and-github), and you can find us in the #help-with-circuitpython and #circuitpython-dev channels on the [Adafruit Discord](https://adafru.it/discord).

## What’s the CircuitPython team up to this week?

What is the team up to this week? Let’s check in!

**Kattni**

My last day working with Adafruit was Friday, September 22, 2023. I want to say thank you to everyone in this community. This community is a huge part of what started this chapter in my life, and my involvement with it has been one of the most fulfilling and amazing things I’ve done over the last five years. I would not be where I am today without the support and encouragement I received from so many folks along the way. You have read my guides, helped me with code and bugs, taught me new things, and so much more. 

One of the best things has been you telling me when something I suggested, created or helped create had a positive impact on you or folks you know. Keep sharing those stories. Thank you for being amazing, thank you for being a part of the welcoming, positive, supportive place that we’ve created together, and finally, thank you for welcoming me as a community leader and giving me the opportunity to gain the experience of building an open source community.

**Melissa**

This week I continued working on going through issues in the various GitHub repos starting with Blinka. I also went through and updated the configuration and documentation settings so that everything was building properly. Eventually I moved over to working on the Blinka `Displayio` issues by updating the code to better align it with the CircuitPython `displayio` code layout and making it more readable.

**Tim**

This week I ran the RTD Theme fix patch with the Adabot Utility that applies the patch to all Libraries. It was my first time using this functionality of Adabot, I was shown how prior but had no "hands on" experience. There were a handful that it failed to push, so I also created PRs on those ones with the same fix. I also tested some changes to the Ethernet `Wiznet5k` Library, and I've been continuing work on a templating engine with a community member.

**Jeff**

I added code to the core to initialize dot clock LCD displays that require use of an I2C bus expander. This sounds pretty esoteric, but is needed in order to support the built in LCD screen on the Espressif ESP32-S3 LCD Evaluation Kit.

I'm also helping out Dan with the MicroPython 1.20 merge. We're making progress but there are a large number of errors to fix, first in the build process and then the problems that turn up during automated and manual testing. This merge is one of the things that we want to get done before the first alpha release of CircuitPython 9.

It had been months since I had time to do a keyboard conversion guide. That changed this past week when I took a couple of hours to write up a conversion of the Unicomp "Mini M" tenkeyless keyboard to use CircuitPython. You can find it on the [learn playground](https://adafruit-playground.com/u/jepler/pages/unicomp-micro-m-with-circuitpython). This buckling spring keyboard was recently updated with a Raspberry Pi Pico as the controller, which makes putting CircuitPython easy, if you don't mind potentially voiding your warranty by opening up the enclosure.

**Scott**

Last week I finished up the Espressif IDF 5.0 update for CircuitPython and [made a PR](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/pull/8411). I also [started the 5.1 merge during my stream](https://www.youtube.com/live/VsuwSUXU9q0?si=_F7I8HPU9njNqr6q&t=2621). More changes were needed this week to enable ESP32-C6 support but it is working now. Code size is still an issue unfortunately. The 5.1 update should come pretty quickly after 5.0.

**Liz**

This week I worked on the Adafruit Learning System guide for the [LED Matrix Sports Scoreboard](https://learn.adafruit.com/led-matrix-sports-scoreboard). This project uses four 64x32 RGB LED matrices with the Matrix Portal S3 to fetch data from the ESPN API for various sports and leagues. I took the hero shots while the New England Patriots were playing against the Miami Dolphins and, although they ultimately lost to the Dolphins, it was fun to see the data update alongside the live feed.
