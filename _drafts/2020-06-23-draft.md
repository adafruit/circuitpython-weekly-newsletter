## A Scrolling LED Matrix Sign

[![Scrolling LED Matrix Sign](../assets/20200623/20200623sign.gif)](https://twitter.com/makermelissa/status/1274484105653018624)

CircuitPythonista Melissa LeBlanc-Williams has been working on a large multi-LED matrix display.

The LED Matrix Sign is a project  I have been wanting to work on for the last 30 years.  I saw that the Project MC2 Pink Pixel Purses were very inexpensive on Amazon,  I ordered 6 and disassembled them. Other hardware includes an Adafruit RGB Matrix bonnet and a Raspberry Pi 3B+.

One goal was to run this project with Python because I wanted to easily be able to script out messages or a series of messages. I was pleasantly surprised to find the Henner Zeller RGB Matrix library. Recently I have been working on developing the displayio library for Adafruit Blinka, which runs on Raspberry Pi, and is built on top of the Pillow library. 

At this point I got to work designing an enclosure that I could 3D print. The enclosure was designed around a couple of 3/4 inch pieces of angled aluminum. I ended up with a very modular design so that I could print multiple copies of parts on multiple printers simultaneously and just assemble them together. I designed a couple of wall mount pieces that just slid onto the aluminum so that I could mount it on my wall. To finish the enclosure off, I bought a sheet of chemist black LED acrylic from TAP plastics.

Once I had everything physically mounted, I went to work on developing a library that would allow easy scripting of the sign. I decided to have my library work directly with Pillow so that I could have some good control of the graphics. I looked up some instruction manuals for some commercially available signs to see what their available functions were and method of programming and decided on using a single background and foreground for simplicity’s sake. The foreground consists of a canvas that expands automatically as you add stuff to it and the main sign class that allows you to set a background and has some animation functions that will apply display the canvas in various way. I plan on releasing the library on Github so that others can make use of it.

## What’s the team up to this week?

What is the team up to this week? Let’s check in!

**Bryan**

Since we last spoke I've been as usual writing libraries, testing hardware, writing and updating guides, helping with support, and generally keeping busy.

In the library department, the last two weeks saw me

* Complete and release the ICM20X libraries,
* Update the LPS2X CircuitPython library to include the LSP22
* Test and merge some PRs for the still-very-alpha APDS9500 library
* Start and finish the SHTC3 CircuitPython library

Hardware wise I assembled and tested the SHTC3 and LPS22 breakouts, mostly do allow for development of the libraries as Ladyada had already vetted the designs while working on the Arduino libraries

To accompany the above library and hardware work, I also did a fair amount of guide work:

* Completed and published the LIS331/H3LIS331 guide
* Update the LPS25 guide to add coverage of the LPS22
* Wrote and published the the SHTC3 guide
* Helped out with example code and assets for Kattni's guide on the ST 9-DoF combo breakouts and wings

And lastly all the above guides I wrote or published had blog coverage written as well.

[![Bryan](../assets/20200623/bryan.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CAN_bus#Frames)

I also started research and ordered parts for a project I've been poking at for a while: a [CAN bus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CAN_bus) board. CAN bus is robust bus standard widely used in modern cars to allow different automated things like power windows, locking systems, radios, and even the engine controls and braking systems communicate as needed.

This is only just the beginning, and CAN bus is only the most low level part of these networks, comparable to ethernet or wifi, so there is a lot more to do [at higher levels](https://www.sti-innsbruck.at/sites/default/files/courses/fileadmin/documents/vn-ws0809/03-vn-CAN-HLP.pdf) to be able to get an idea of what is talking to what.  

**Dan**

Now that the first version of the [Adafruit_Blinka_bleio](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_Blinka_bleio) library is essentially finished, my next BLE quest is to reimplement \_bleio again, this time using the ESP32 HCI interface as the low level. The ESP32 is what we use for WiFi on our AirLift boards, but it also supports bluetoothHCI, a serial protocol that is pretty standard among Bluetooth adapters. Most Bluetooth USB dongles implement it, for instance. So once I have it working on ESP32, it should also be usable for other adapters that implement HCI.

**Jeff**

Among other things, I've been working on improvements to our documentation, in two main areas.

First, I improved the ability to switch between the 5.x documentation and the latest documentation on ReadTheDocs with fewer "page not found" errors. Many URLs changed when we started using "autoapi" to help us generate documentation, but with configuration changes and redirects, many old URLs will continue to work automatically.

Second, I started work on removing offensive terminology from our documentation and from the names of modules and functions in the core of CircuitPython. While we are still coming to a consensus about replacement terms to use, this is something that the team agrees is important. As the draft document explaining our motivation says, "we disfavor language that due to historical and social context can make community members and potential community members feel unwelcome."

**Kattni**

[![Kattni](../assets/20200623/kattni.jpg)](https://circuitpython.org/)

This week I published a guide for 9-DoF combo breakouts and FeatherWings with sensors from ST. This guide includes three very similar boards that work with nearly identical code. The guide includes all kinds of information about these boards including pinouts, Arduino usage, CircuitPython and Python usage, and many resources to download, including datasheets, schematics and more. If you've picked up one of the new 9-DoF boards and you're looking for where to get started, check out the [ST 9-DoF Combo Breakouts and Wings guide](https://learn.adafruit.com/st-9-dof-combo).

Following the guide, I'm taking the opportunity to go through my assigned GitHub issues and any PRs I was tagged on. It's good to spend some time on this every so often to make sure things are getting addressed and completed. 

**Lucian**

This past week I worked on fixing an I2C timing issue on the F7 and H7 boards, RGB Matrix testing, adding the i.MX 1050 EVK board, and a variety of other minor bugs and annoyances. As always I'm trying to learn new things about bugs as they're resolved, so I can avoid issues in the future or fix deeper structural issues that could cause more instability later on.

In my own time I've been soldering together one of Joey Castillo's [E-Book Featherwing](https://www.tindie.com/products/joeycastillo/the-e-book-wing-pcb-bare-pcb/) e-readers, which I'm hoping to use for a language flashcard program. I'm looking forward to digging deeper into his unicode support platform, which looks pretty handy so far! I'm always excited to see new open source designs emerge to replace devices that are usually so complex we think of them as untouchable, like tablets, phones and readers

**Melissa**

This past week, I finished working some more on displayio for Blinka. One of the displays that I found particularly challenging was the SSD1331 despite the fact that I originally added the code to CircuitPython to get it working. The reason was that despite it wanting to accept all data as commands, sometimes it wanted commands sent as data which I found kind of weird. Using a combination of hooking up a logic probe to compare it the the Adafruit_CircuitPython_RGB_Display library and carefully comparing CircuitPython, Blinka displayio, and the RGB Display library, I was able to figure that out.

I also wrote a script for the Raspberry Pi, though it could really run on any board that supports Blinka and I2c, that will step you through calibrating a 9-DoF sensor using the command line. I'm currently working on writing up a guide page on using this script which will be one of the easiest ways to calibrate the sensor.

**Scott**

Since last week I've been focused on two ESP32-S2 tasks. The first is to finish busio by adding SPI support. It's been much trickier than I2C and UART because the API provided by the ESP IDF is higher level than the one CircuitPython exposes. It's highlighted memory management challenges that we ignored for the other two buses.

The second ESP related task is testing the UF2 bootloader that Thach has created. I tested it and also added the ability to double tap like other UF2 bootloaders. The double tap support requires an external resistor and capacitor to store one bit of memory because the reset button on ESP boards disables power to all ESP-powered memories.

I go over all of this in [my stream from last week](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v2iXG6GISQI).
