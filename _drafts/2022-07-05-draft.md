Welcome to the latest Python on Microcontrollers newsletter! We highlight new boards supported by Python most every week. Nut this week it's a Raspberry Pi board and that's always received well (for capabilities and price). The Raspberry Pi Pico W will set a new standard for use of WiFi in projects by shear ubiquity, even if Espressif has been in this space for a long time (with integrated chips).

We're on [Discord](https://discord.gg/HYqvREz), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/search?q=circuitpython&src=typed_query&f=live), and for past newsletters - [view them all here](https://www.adafruitdaily.com/category/circuitpython/). If you're reading this on the web, [subscribe here](https://www.adafruitdaily.com/). Here's the news this week:

## Introducing the New Raspberry Pi Pico W

[![Raspberry Pi Pico W](../assets/20220705/20220705pw.jpg)](https://www.raspberrypi.com/news/raspberry-pi-pico-w-your-6-iot-platform/)

June 30th, Raspberry Pi launched three new members of their Pico family. Raspberry Pi Pico W is priced at $6, and brings 802.11n wireless networking to the Pico platform while retaining complete pin compatibility by adding an Infineon [CYW43439](https://www.infineon.com/cms/en/product/wireless-connectivity/airoc-wi-fi-plus-bluetooth-combos/cyw43439/) wireless chip. 

The CYW43439 supports both Bluetooth Classic and Bluetooth Low-Energy per the [datasheet](https://datasheets.raspberrypi.com/picow/pico-w-datasheet.pdf). Raspberry Pi has not enabled Bluetooth on Pico W at launch, but may do so in the future.

Getting started guides for C and MicroPython, as well as links to API level documentation are available in the [microcontrollers section](https://www.raspberrypi.com/documentation/microcontrollers/) of the Raspberry Pi documentation site. They expect more demos and documentation to be released in the next month or two. CircuitPython does not currently support the Pico W.

[![Raspberry Pi Pico H](../assets/20220705/20220705ph.jpg)](https://www.raspberrypi.com/news/raspberry-pi-pico-w-your-6-iot-platform/)

Pico H ($5) and Pico WH ($7) add pre-populated headers, and a new 3-pin debug/UART connector, to Pico and Pico W respectively. The connector is a 1.0mm pitch 3-pin JST ‘SH’ connector SM03B-SRSS-TB.

Pico H and Pico W are available now; Pico WH will follow in August. It was first available from UK retailers and is expected in US retailers shortly.

## New Boards Supported by CircuitPython

The number of supported microcontrollers and Single Board Computers (SBC) grows every week. This section outlines which boards have been included in CircuitPython or added to [CircuitPython.org](https://circuitpython.org/).

This week, there were (#/no) new boards added!

- [Board name](url)
- [Board name](url)
- [Board name](url)

*Note: For non-Adafruit boards, please use the support forums of the board manufacturer for assistance, as Adafruit does not have the hardware to assist in troubleshooting.*

Looking to add a new board to CircuitPython? It's highly encouraged! Adafruit has four guides to help you do so:

- [How to Add a New Board to CircuitPython](https://learn.adafruit.com/how-to-add-a-new-board-to-circuitpython/overview)
- [How to add a New Board to the circuitpython.org website](https://learn.adafruit.com/how-to-add-a-new-board-to-the-circuitpython-org-website)

## CircuitPython Libraries!

[![CircuitPython Libraries](../assets/20220705/blinka.png)](https://circuitpython.org/libraries)

CircuitPython support for hardware continues to grow. We are adding support for new sensors and breakouts all the time, as well as improving on the drivers we already have. As we add more libraries and update current ones, you can keep up with all the changes right here!

For the latest libraries, download the [Adafruit CircuitPython Library Bundle](https://circuitpython.org/libraries). For the latest community contributed libraries, download the [CircuitPython Community Bundle](https://github.com/adafruit/CircuitPython_Community_Bundle/releases).

If you'd like to contribute, CircuitPython libraries are a great place to start. Have an idea for a new driver? File an issue on [CircuitPython](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/issues)! Have you written a library you'd like to make available? Submit it to the [CircuitPython Community Bundle](https://github.com/adafruit/CircuitPython_Community_Bundle). Interested in helping with current libraries? Check out the [CircuitPython.org Contributing page](https://circuitpython.org/contributing). We've included open pull requests and issues from the libraries, and details about repo-level issues that need to be addressed. We have a guide on [contributing to CircuitPython with Git and GitHub](https://learn.adafruit.com/contribute-to-circuitpython-with-git-and-github) if you need help getting started. You can also find us in the #circuitpython channels on the [Adafruit Discord](https://adafru.it/discord).

You can check out this [list of all the Adafruit CircuitPython libraries and drivers available](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_Bundle/blob/master/circuitpython_library_list.md). 

The current number of CircuitPython libraries is **357**!

**Updated Libraries!**

Here's this week's updated CircuitPython libraries:

 * [Adafruit_CircuitPython_RSA](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_RSA)
 * [Adafruit_CircuitPython_hashlib](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_hashlib)

## What’s the team up to this week?

What is the team up to this week? Let’s check in!

**Dan**

I'm continuing to work on porting CircuitPython to plain ESP32 (no suffIx) processors. The first target is the new Feather ESP32 V2 board.

The ESP32 doesn't have native USB, but ESP32 boards often include a serial-to-USB converter chip, connected to a UART on the ESP32. This is also true of ESP32-C3 and the micro:bit nRF boards. I refactored the serial support used on those boards to be more general, and now I've made the REPL available via this USB serial connection. I'll be testing the other functionality of Feather ESP32 board.

**Kattni**

This week I worked on a guide for a GitHub Actions status tower light. It uses a USB-controlled tower light to show the status of your latest Actions run on a repo you specify. I also included files for a 3D printed stand to bolt onto the bottom to make the light more stable. Guide should be out soon, so keep an eye out for that!

**Tim**

I worked on writing classes to show and animate sprites for a PyGamer port of an old Nintendo Game & Watch handheld game called Octopus. I've also cut out, scaled, re-packed, and prepared all the bitmap assets for the game. I reviewed a few typing  PRs. I made a pass through the github workflow status script I wrote recently to add more thorough documentation and assisted Kattni in understanding it so it can be written up for a Learn Guide. 

**Scott**

This week I polished up my web workflow code and [sent it out for review](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/pull/6528). It will enable file editing through a web server presented by CircuitPython.

In the interim I fixed a couple bugs including a crash on ESP32-S3 that was introduced with my auto-wifi work.

Yesterday I began work on adding a WebSocket url to the server that will allow interacting with the serial connection to CircuitPython. I'll continue that work in addition to responding to review comments on the first PR.

**Liz**

This week I worked on a [Cassette Mod guide with JP](https://learn.adafruit.com/walkmellotron) and [an updated STEMMA guide](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-4-channel-adc-breakouts) for the ADS1115 and ADS1015 ADC boards. JP and I worked on two different ways to use CircuitPython to modify cassette players. My mod is the more chaotic of the two and uses an L9110 motor driver with a potentiometer to control the speed and direction.

This coming week I'll be working on a project with the NAU7802 STEMMA board to create a food scale. A container will sit on a platform and its weight will be measured by a strain gauge. I'll also be using an alphanumeric display for the GUI.
