## Python Gains 2%, Remains Top Programming Language

[![Python #1](../assets/20220816/20220816python.jpg)](https://www.tiobe.com/tiobe-index/)

‘Unstoppable’ Python once again ranked No. 1 in the August updates of both the Tiobe and Pypl indexes of programming language popularity - [TIOBE](https://www.tiobe.com/tiobe-index/) and [Infoworld](https://www.infoworld.com/article/3669232/python-popularity-still-soaring.html).

## New Browser-based micro:bit Python Editor Launching in September

[![micro:bit Python Editor](../assets/20220816/20220816microbit.jpg)](https://twitter.com/4pip/status/1557714643371675650)

The new micro:bit editor runs in a browser, so it’s quite different to Thonny or Mu. It will be launching in September but the beta is online and can be used now - [Twitter Thread](https://twitter.com/4pip/status/1557714643371675650) and [Beta on the Web](https://python.microbit.org/v/beta).

## The Azure Embedded Wireless Framework APIs for IoT

[![The Azure Embedded Wireless Framework APIs](../assets/20220816/20220816azure.jpg)](https://blog.adafruit.com/2022/08/12/the-azure-embedded-wireless-framework-apis-opensource-azure-iot-microsoft-azure/)

The Azure Embedded Wireless Framework simplifies the development of internet and cloud connectivity for embedded device software by providing a defined interface for wireless network adapters, host interfaces, platform adaptations, and software stack extensions through a set of APIs.

The goal is to provide a standard framework for writing applications and controlling wireless network adapters (cellular, WiFi, …) while abstracting a driver interface for hardware vendors to plug in modules with self-developed drivers - [GitHub](https://github.com/Azure/embedded-wireless-framework) and [Adafruit Blog](https://blog.adafruit.com/2022/08/12/the-azure-embedded-wireless-framework-apis-opensource-azure-iot-microsoft-azure/).

## New Boards Supported by CircuitPython

The number of supported microcontrollers and Single Board Computers (SBC) grows every week. This section outlines which boards have been included in CircuitPython or added to [CircuitPython.org](https://circuitpython.org/).

This week, there were no new boards added, but several are in progress.

*Note: For non-Adafruit boards, please use the support forums of the board manufacturer for assistance, as Adafruit does not have the hardware to assist in troubleshooting.*

Looking to add a new board to CircuitPython? It's highly encouraged! Adafruit has four guides to help you do so:

- [How to Add a New Board to CircuitPython](https://learn.adafruit.com/how-to-add-a-new-board-to-circuitpython/overview)
- [How to add a New Board to the circuitpython.org website](https://learn.adafruit.com/how-to-add-a-new-board-to-the-circuitpython-org-website)

## New Learn Guides!

[![New Learn Guides](../assets/20220816/20220816learn.gif)](https://learn.adafruit.com/guides/latest)

## CircuitPython Libraries!

[![CircuitPython Libraries](../assets/20220816/blinka.png)](https://circuitpython.org/libraries)

CircuitPython support for hardware continues to grow. We are adding support for new sensors and breakouts all the time, as well as improving on the drivers we already have. As we add more libraries and update current ones, you can keep up with all the changes right here!

For the latest libraries, download the [Adafruit CircuitPython Library Bundle](https://circuitpython.org/libraries). For the latest community contributed libraries, download the [CircuitPython Community Bundle](https://github.com/adafruit/CircuitPython_Community_Bundle/releases).

If you'd like to contribute, CircuitPython libraries are a great place to start. Have an idea for a new driver? File an issue on [CircuitPython](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/issues)! Have you written a library you'd like to make available? Submit it to the [CircuitPython Community Bundle](https://github.com/adafruit/CircuitPython_Community_Bundle). Interested in helping with current libraries? Check out the [CircuitPython.org Contributing page](https://circuitpython.org/contributing). We've included open pull requests and issues from the libraries, and details about repo-level issues that need to be addressed. We have a guide on [contributing to CircuitPython with Git and GitHub](https://learn.adafruit.com/contribute-to-circuitpython-with-git-and-github) if you need help getting started. You can also find us in the #circuitpython channels on the [Adafruit Discord](https://adafru.it/discord).

You can check out this [list of all the Adafruit CircuitPython libraries and drivers available](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_Bundle/blob/master/circuitpython_library_list.md). 

The current number of CircuitPython libraries is **362**!

**New Libraries!**

Here's this week's new CircuitPython libraries:

 * [Adafruit_CircuitPython_MAX1704x](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_MAX1704x)

**Updated Libraries!**

## What’s the team up to this week?

What is the team up to this week? Let’s check in!

**Dan**

I fixed about half a dozen issues for the 8.0.0 release, and am continuing to work on more. As Scott mentions below, we're making good progress knocking off the remaining issues.

**Jeff**

The camera functionality I've mentioned in a couple of recent reports has been merged. This code is working really well on the ESP32-S2 and ESP32-S3, which was the main goal. It's also enabled for the original ESP32, but there seem to be some reliability problems. Overall, it's a very nice step forward in how Circuitpython can work with cameras on Espressif microcontrollers. https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/pull/6684

I was also learning for myself about asyncio, and found a small change to the "core" which can greatly increase the efficiency of (for instance) waiting for keypad keypresses in one async task and doing other activities in another. This really needs a library (yet to be written) to package it all up, but I was happy to dig a little deeper and learn enough to do this. https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/pull/6712


**Kattni**

**Melissa**

This past week, I've continued working on [code.circuitpython.org](https://code.circuitpython.org/) and have been adding lots of features as well as revising dialogs and other UI elements. Coming up soon I'll be making preparations for a CircuitPython Day livestream where I build a little project that runs CircuitPython. Be sure to catch in on 8/19/2022 at 1:00 PM EST.

**Tim**

I was out for vacation the majority of the week and did not do much with CircuitPython during that. The tinkering that I did do was starting an effort to measure library RAM size, and .mpy file size as a proxy for RAM. I created a new github actions task that can output the .mpy file size for every PR branch automatically when it's submitted. Next up is trying to measure the RAM usage on a physical device.

**Scott**

This past week has been a continuation of the web workflow and ESP bugfixing of last week. We're trying to fix as many 8.0.0 bugs as we can so that we can get to a stable release. We started with 50 open issues and now have 41. We've fixed more than 9 but also found a few more along the way. Our goal is to have a beta of CircuitPython 8 before CircuitPython Day, August 19th.

I've removed two APIs that were being phased out in 7.x for removal in 8.x. One was ScanEntry.matches(all=) which was replaced by match_all= to avoid the Python keyword all. The other was removing the PWMOut argument to PulseOut. The ESP chips use a different hardware peripheral from PWM so the API didn't fit for it. The new API takes in a pin and then lets the port decide exactly how to implement it.

I've also done a number of reliability fixes for the web workflow and for the title bar.

This is my last week before I go back on paternity leave so I'll be fixing as many bugs as I can before I'm off. Hopefully there won't be much more for Jeff and Dan to fix once I'm done.

**Liz**

This past week I worked on a guide for the new [MMC5603 magnetometer](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-mmc5603-triple-axis-magnetometer) and wrote code for the [Two Way Telegraph with Analog Feedback Servos project](https://learn.adafruit.com/two-way-display-with-analog-feedback-servos). 

I also did a PR and testing for the updated MCP4728 STEMMA board, which may ship with an MCP4728A4 IC. The IC is identical to the MCP4728 but has a different default I2C address. The [PR to the CircuitPython library](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_MCP4728/pull/13) allows for both I2C addresses and the product guide has documentation for folks to change the I2C address in the code. Big thanks to tekktrik for reviewing the PR since it was my first PR for a CircuitPython library.
