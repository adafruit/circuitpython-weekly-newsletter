## MicroPython 1.19 Released

[![MicroPython 1.19](../assets/20220621/20220621mp119.jpg)](https://github.com/micropython/micropython/releases/tag/v1.19)

[MicroPython](https://www.micropython.org/) v1.19 was just released! The release has seen a big change to the format of MicroPython's .mpy files. These files - which contain precompiled bytecode - now contain mostly static data which is ready to execute without any changes (previously a lot of linking steps were required when importing .mpy files). This simplifies things and improves import speed, and most importantly will soon allow you to easily "freeze" precompiled bytecode into a linear filesystem, without needing to rebuild the main firmware. This dynamic freezing feature will be available in a future release.

There are many other enhancements, fixes and additions in v1.19, including a new port to Renesas RA microcontrollers. One neat addition is the ability to customise the REPL prompt (the >>> part) by setting sys.ps1 (and sys.ps2) to whatever string you like. This can be very useful to distinguish different boards, by making sys.ps1 unique on each of them. For example "D2> " on a PYBD-SF2, or "RP> " on a RP2040-based board - [Release Notes](https://github.com/micropython/micropython/releases/tag/v1.19), [Changelog](https://micropython.org/resources/micropython-ChangeLog.txt), [Forum Post](https://forum.micropython.org/viewtopic.php?t=12557&p=68013#p68013) and [Downloads](https://micropython.org/download).

## GitHub CEO Discusses Big Changes for Developers

[![GitHub CEO Discusses Big Changes](../assets/20220621/20220621github.jpg)](https://twitter.com/github/status/1537148403121004549)

GitHub CEO [Thomas Dohmke](https://twitter.com/ashtom) spoke at [WeAreDevelopers](https://www.wearedevelopers.com/) recently and shared his thoughts on the big changes ahead for developers - [Twitter Thread](https://twitter.com/github/status/1537148403121004549). 

Some of the points:

* “There will be greater change in the next 5 years than in the last 40. We are entering a fundamental transformation of software development as we know it…and I think it will make us all happier.”
* “Whether it’s the AI pair programmer…or the readily available Codespaces for a project that you want to contribute back to -- all these things will help you with the things that you don’t want to do, so you can spend more time enjoying the things that you do.”
* “In fact, in files where Copilot is enabled, we are already seeing nearly 40% of the code being suggested by Copilot. In five years, I predict that number will be 80%.”
* “I think the shift to the cloud will happen at such a rapid rate, that in just a few years I predict there will be no more code on your local computer.”

## What’s the team up to this week?

What is the team up to this week? Let’s check in!

**Dan**

I have been working for a couple of weeks on CircuitPython hangs that occur on the MatrixPortal when the matrix is in use and there is network activity. I may have found the problem. Updating the RGB matrix is a CPU-intensive activity that runs as a high-priority interrupt routine. the bidirectional SPI startup for each communication with the ESP32 co-processor was not atomic, and I believe a rare but possible delay between starting receive and transmit caused the problem. Making the startups be a single atomic operation seems to fix things.

I also fixed a second bug in the ESP32SPI Python library; my initial fix was not good enough.

**Kattni**

This week I've been working on a guide walking you through how to make a GitHub profile that is both memorable and representative of you. This guide turned out to be a bit beefier than expected, but so far I'm really happy with the content. The last step is covering a number of tools to help you create beautiful content in various ways. I'll be updating my profile to show these tools in action. If you're interested in creating a GitHub profile, or snazzing your current one up a bit, check out this guide when it goes live!

**Melissa**

[![Melissa](../assets/20220621/20220621melissa.jpg)](https://circuitpython.org/)

This past week I updated the HT16K33 library so that it supported multiple displays as a single display. This required digging into some low level stuff, but I'm very happy with the results. I will no be around for the next few weeks, so there won't be new updates for a bit.

**Tim**

This week I made a script that polls Github API to get the actions workflow run status. It will be used for an upcoming guide with a Repository status light. I tested the mpy-cross build process and resulting library file with a new kind of typing syntax in it. I also tried out the beginnings of the web workflow that Scott showed on S&T. I'm tinkering with the pages that it serves trying to make one that allows editing files on the device from the browser.

**Scott**

This week I've merged in the auto-wifi support into CircuitPython. Now when the .env file has an SSID and password set, CircuitPython will auto-connect to the WiFi network. It will also keep that connection across resets. This is useful for the upcoming web workflow that allows for editing files from a web browser or REST API.

After merging the auto-wifi PR in, I continued work on webserver in CircuitPython. I've gotten reading the filesystem working and will continue to work on other pieces of a "workflow". The BLE workflow has been a good reference because it lays out all of the desired interactions clearly.

**Liz**

I returned this week after being out last week. I started by working on the [QT Py ESP32-S3 board guide](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-qt-py-esp32-s3). It still has a couple of pages that need to be wrapped up but the bulk of the information is there for folks that want to get started. Huge thanks to Kattni for her help with it- the board guides are very large and require a lot of attention to detail and as usual she was extremely helpful answering my many questions that came up along the way.

I'm now switching gears to playing with cassette tapes and strain gauges, though not together. I'm working with JP on some CircuitPython cassette hacking. We'll be doing a guide showing two different methods on controlling tape players with CircuitPython. For the strain gauge, after doing the new product guide for the NAU7802 STEMMA board I wanted to try and come up with a project for it. I'm going to be building an IoT pet food tracker where a strain gauge measures the weight of the food left in a container and can track the usage over time and alert you when you need to fill up the container. I was testing with a can of cat food and was able to get an accurate reading in both grams and ounces from the NAU7802's raw value with CircuitPython.
