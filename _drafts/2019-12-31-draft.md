## A HAH! A CLUE!

[![CLUE](../assets/12312019/123119cluelogo.png)](https://youtu.be/uNDqkglM8_Y)

[![CLUE](../assets/12312019/123119clueprotos.jpg)](https://youtu.be/uNDqkglM8_Y)

[![CLUE](../assets/12312019/123119clue.gif)](https://youtu.be/uNDqkglM8_Y)

Coming soon, our latest CircuitPython powered board, CLUE! Here's a bit more, and the TOP SECRET video - [YouTube](https://youtu.be/uNDqkglM8_Y):

>_"we wanted to build some projects that have a small screen and a lot of sensors. this board has a 1.3″ 240×240 ips tft display, two buttons, and a ton of sensors: lsm series 9 dof motion, apds9960 light/color/proximity, pdm microphone, humidity, temperature and barometric environmental sensing. there’s a qwiic/stemmaqt connector for adding more sensors like pm2.5 air quality and others that were too big to fit on the board. we’ll be primarily using circuitpython for programming it, but it will also work in arduino. and of course, we’d love to see makecode on it! after designing it, the board was close enough to micro:bit-shape-size that we moved a few parts to make it fit in micro:bit robots and some projects – the nrf52840 is a big upgrade chip and can do stuff like tensorflow lite for microcontrollers, ble central and peripheral, and more."_

[Hackster.io has some coverage](https://www.hackster.io/news/get-a-clue-about-the-world-with-adafruit-s-new-board-the-clue-7901884a7a28) as well.

## Program in Python with LEGO EV3

[![LEGO](../assets/12312019/123119lego.jpg)](https://education.lego.com/en-us/support/mindstorms-ev3/python-for-ev3)

Follow up, looks like this is now live - [Python for EV3](https://education.lego.com/en-us/support/mindstorms-ev3/python-for-ev3):

>_"You can now use your EV3 Brick to unleash the power of Python programming using MicroPython. Simply install the EV3 MicroPython image onto any micro SD card and boot up your EV3 Brick from it to start programming straight away. Switching back to the standard LEGO® MINDSTORMS® EV3 firmware is just as simple. We have also provided full documentation and sample API code to get you started."_

## Call for help – CircuitPython messaging to other languages!

[![Hello world](../assets/12312019/123119helloworld.jpg)](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/issues/1098)

We [recently posted on the Adafruit blog](https://blog.adafruit.com/2018/08/15/help-bring-circuitpython-messaging-to-other-languages-circuitpython/) about bringing CircuitPython messaging to other languages, one of the exciting features of CircuitPython 4.x is translated control and error messages. Native language messages will help non-native English speakers understand what is happening in CircuitPython even though the Python keywords and APIs will still be in English. If you would like to help, [please post](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/issues/1098) to the main issue on GitHub and join us on [Discord](https://adafru.it/discord).

We made this graphic with translated text, we could use your help with that to make sure we got the text right, please check out the text in the image – if there is anything we did not get correct, please let us know. Dan sent me this [handy site too](http://helloworldcollection.de/#Human).
