FEATHER takes flight with the Wio Lite W600 from Seeed Studio - [Adafruit](https://blog.adafruit.com/2019/08/06/feather-takes-flight-with-the-wio-lite-w600-from-seeed-studio-seeedstudio-adafruit-feather/).

>_"[Wio Lite](https://www.seeedstudio.com/Wio-Lite-W600-p-4155.html) is a new product line from Seeed, and Wio Lite W600 is the first product in this series. Similar to the great Adafruit Feather series, the Wio Lite series is small in size and uniform in pins. Different performance and features are available when equipped with different processors and modules. Actually, Wio Lite is compatible with Feather board pins, we believe Feather is a very successful development platform in the community, and there are already many cool Feather boards out there from Adafruit. The Wio Lite aims at adding different wireless solutions to enrich the Feather community and provide more possibility for Feather users. On top of that, we’ve released the Grove Shield for Wio Lite at the same time. With this shield, we bring over 200 Grove sensors, actuators and displays to Wio Lite series and the Feather community."_

## PyCon AU

_THE_ Australian event for all things Python, PyCon AU 2019 was a huge success with many diverse and high-quality talks that covered the gamut of Python topics. MicroPython and CircuitPython were _very_ well represented with six talks covering Python on Hardware.

All of the 80+ talks were recorded and published on YouTube - take a look at the [PyCon AU 2019 playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLs4CJRBY5F1LKqauI3V4E_xflt6Gow611) or [browse the schedule](https://2019.pycon-au.org/schedule/friday/). 

MicroPython Sprints were organised for the Monday and Tuesday and these were well attended with some productive work achieved! Beginners to MicroPython (like [Leo](https://tumblelog.halloleo.net/post/186930271429/i-built-my-first-microcontroller-thing)) were warmly introduced, Damien guided folks to work on a spate of issues, two variants of a C stub generator ([uStubby](https://github.com/pazzarpj/micropython-ustubby) and [MicroPython C Stub Gen](https://gitlab.com/oliver.robson/mpy-c-stub-gen)) were worked on, the [QR Displayer](https://gitlab.com/oliver.robson/micropython-qr-displayer) project was released, a [CI server](https://gitlab.com/alelec/micropython_ci/) was configured to build _all_ (nearly 100!) the officially supported MicroPython variants and ♥️ was expressed with a [micro:bit](https://twitter.com/weatheredpup/status/1158705177613836288)! There was also collaboration with the [Fomu project](https://www.crowdsupply.com/sutajio-kosagi/fomu) and a port of MicroPython was built to run on the RISC-V softcore running on the Fomu FPGA - that lives _inside_ a USB port!

Continue the discussion on the [MicroPython Slack workspace](https://slack-micropython.herokuapp.com/)!

[![Goodbye Print Statements, Hello Debugger](../assets/08132019/81319prints.jpg)](https://youtu.be/HHrVBKZLolg)

["Goodbye Print Statements, Hello Debugger!"](https://2019.pycon-au.org/talks/goodbye-print-statements-hello-debugger) - Nina Zakharenko. Still debugging your code with print statements? Learn how to level up your ability to troubleshoot complex code situations by using the power of a fully-featured debugger in this talk aimed at all levels of programming ability - [YouTube](https://youtu.be/HHrVBKZLolg).

["What makes Micro:bits different?"](https://2019.pycon-au.org/talks/what-makes-microbits-different) - Jack Reichelt. There’s many different ways to learn to code, and how you start your students’ journey changes what challenges they’ll face.This talk will highlight some of the differences when using Micro:bits, and how to overcome the challenges. [YouTube](https://youtu.be/ZEg0cLKwzF4)

["Using comedy as an excuse to play with python-programmed microcontrollers"](https://2019.pycon-au.org/talks/using-comedy-as-an-excuse-to-play-with-python-programmed-microcontrollers) - Anthony I. Joseph and Debbie Zukerman. Early-career comedians often have difficulties adding electronic props to their acts, due to the high cost of materials and fabrication skills required. This talk will recreate several props used in comedic performances, showing the code and components used. [YouTube](https://youtu.be/6Rv7S_74fck)

["Profiling Pathogens with (micro) Python"](https://2019.pycon-au.org/talks/profiling-athogens-with-micro-python) - Andrew Leech. We’re building professional medical diagnostics equipment with MicroPython. This has come with minimal challenges, many positives and a few surprises! [YouTube](https://youtu.be/YovngSLXoxw)

["It's dark and my lights aren't working (an asyncio success story)"](https://2019.pycon-au.org/talks/its-dark-and-my-lights-arent-working-an-asyncio-success-story) - Jim Mussared. I have invested huge amounts of time in achieving a simple goal – making the lighting in my home “smart”. It’s not ground breaking, nor is it practical or cost effective, but it sure was educational, uses a bunch of Python, and the result makes me (and my family) happy. [YouTube](https://youtu.be/grouP9QfdyA)

["Extending MicroPython: Using C for good!"](https://2019.pycon-au.org/talks/extending-micropython-using-c-for-good) - Matt Trentini. MicroPython is a _fantastic_ environment for embedded development. But it is an interpreted language; what happens when you hit performance limitations? Or want to use a new feature of your microcontroller? We’ll look at how MicroPython can be _extended_ to add features and improve performance. [YouTube](https://youtu.be/fUb3Urw4H-E)

["Micropython Gotchas"](https://2019.pycon-au.org/talks/micropython-gotchas) - Michał Gałka. We all somehow get the feeling that MicroPython is not quite the Python we know. During the talk, I’ll show what the “not quite” actually means. I’ll present a set of different issues I stumbled upon when working with different MicroPython powered boards ranging from memory constraints to API calls. [YouTube](https://youtu.be/93ed-YyOWkc)

[![PyperCard](../assets/08132019/81319pypercard.jpg)](https://pypercard.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)

PyperCard - Easy GUIs for All - [pypercard.readthedocs.io](https://pypercard.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). PyperCard is a HyperCard inspired Pythonic GUI framework for beginner programmers. PyperCard makes it quick and easy to create software with a modern user interface to use on your Windows, OSX, Linux, Android or iOS devices. PyperCard was created in response to the work of the wonderful folks at Adafruit who designed a simple GUI library for one of their CircuitPython based devices. PyperCard takes Adafruit’s original concept, refines it and makes it available on a large number of computing platforms. To achieve this, PyperCard currently uses the Kivy UI framework under the hood.

Check it out! All in Mu!

Why Mu? Mu tries to make it as easy as possible to get started with programming but aims to help you graduate to "real" development tools soon after. Everything in Mu is the "real thing" but presented in as simple and obvious way possible. It's like the toddling stage in learning to walk: you're finding your feet and once you're confident, you should move on and explore! Put simply, Mu aims to foster autonomy. Try out Mu today! - [codewith.mu](https://codewith.mu/)

## Call for help – CircuitPython messaging to other languages!

[![Hello world](../assets/08132019/81319hello.jpg)](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/issues/1098)

We [posted on the Adafruit blog](https://blog.adafruit.com/2018/08/15/help-bring-circuitpython-messaging-to-other-languages-circuitpython/) about bringing CircuitPython messaging to other languages, one of the exciting features of CircuitPython 4.x is translated control and error messages. Native language messages will help non-native English speakers understand what is happening in CircuitPython even though the Python keywords and APIs will still be in English. If you would like to help, [please post](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/issues/1098) to the main issue on GitHub and join us on [Discord](https://adafru.it/discord).

We made this graphic with translated text, we could use your help with that to make sure we got the text right, please check out the text in the image – if there is anything we did not get correct, please let us know. Dan sent me this [handy site too](http://helloworldcollection.de/#Human).
