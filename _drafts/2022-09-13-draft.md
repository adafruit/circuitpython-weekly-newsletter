Welcome to the latest Python on Microcontrollers newsletter! This has been a wonderful week in Python news with many projects completed over the US holiday weekend. On the other side of the Atlantic, the Raspberry Pi folks have released a new version of their namesake operating system with a new camera app that is much more fully featured and Python friendly. Check out all the projects and resources in this issue, something for everyone.

We're on [Discord](https://discord.gg/HYqvREz), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/search?q=circuitpython&src=typed_query&f=live), and for past newsletters - [view them all here](https://www.adafruitdaily.com/category/circuitpython/). If you're reading this on the web, [subscribe here](https://www.adafruitdaily.com/). Here's the news this week:

## The latest update to Raspberry Pi OS

[![The latest update to Raspberry Pi OS](../assets/20220913/20220913pi.jpg)](https://www.raspberrypi.com/news/the-latest-update-to-raspberry-pi-os/)

Raspberry Pi has just released the latest version of Raspberry Pi OS. It is mostly a wrapping-up of all the bug fixes and new versions of software which have been released since the previous image in April; but there are a few small tweaks to the user experience - [Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.com/news/the-latest-update-to-raspberry-pi-os/).

[![PiCamera2](../assets/20220913/20220913pc2.jpg)]([https://www.raspberrypi.com/news/the-latest-update-to-raspberry-pi-os/](https://www.raspberrypi.com/news/picamera2-beta-release/))

One of the new features in the latest set of Raspberry Pi OS images are pre-installed beta release versions of the new Picamera2 Python camera library, a replacement for the old PiCamera Python library. This is a higher-level interface and is easier to use. Picamera2 is supported only on recent Bullseye images. It is not supported on Buster or earlier images, nor on Raspberry Pi OS Legacy; nor is it supported on Bullseye images where the legacy camera stack has been re-enabled - [Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.com/news/picamera2-beta-release/) and [User's Manual](https://datasheets.raspberrypi.com/camera/picamera2-manual.pdf).

## The 2023 Official Raspberry Pi Handbook is Out Now

## Companies Hacking Their Way Around the Chip Shortage

[![Companies Hacking Their Way Around the Chip Shortage](../assets/20220913/20220913hack.jpg)](https://www.wired.com/story/chip-shortage-hacks/)

The supply chain issues have no end in sight, so manufacturers are being forced to improvise. - [Wired](https://www.wired.com/story/chip-shortage-hacks/).

> “There's desperation in the market,” says Bill Wiseman, a senior partner at the consulting firm McKinsey. “If you’re building a $350,000 mass spectrometer, and you can't ship it because you don't have a 50-cent chip, you’re pretty much willing to pay anything.”

Dan Hutcheson, an analyst at TechInsights, who follows the chip industry, says companies have taken desperate measures to deal with previous shortages, including harvesting chips from other products. He also warns that the shortage could quickly turn into a glut, as the economy cools and demand for new products slows. But he also wonders if the current shortage might have another explanation. “There has to be hoarding out there,” Hutcheson says. “I think chips are the new toilet paper.”

## This Week's Python Streams

[![Python Streams](../assets/20220913/cccircuitpython.jpg)](https://circuitpython.org/)

## New Boards Supported by CircuitPython

The number of supported microcontrollers and Single Board Computers (SBC) grows every week. This section outlines which boards have been included in CircuitPython or added to [CircuitPython.org](https://circuitpython.org/).

This week there were two new boards added!

- [ESP32-S3 Box Lite](https://circuitpython.org/board/espressif_esp32s3_box_lite/)
- [LOLIN S3](https://circuitpython.org/board/lolin_s3/)

*Note: For non-Adafruit boards, please use the support forums of the board manufacturer for assistance, as Adafruit does not have the hardware to assist in troubleshooting.*

Looking to add a new board to CircuitPython? It's highly encouraged! Adafruit has four guides to help you do so:

- [How to Add a New Board to CircuitPython](https://learn.adafruit.com/how-to-add-a-new-board-to-circuitpython/overview)

## CircuitPython Libraries!

[![CircuitPython Libraries](../assets/20220913/blinka.png)](https://circuitpython.org/libraries)

CircuitPython support for hardware continues to grow. We are adding support for new sensors and breakouts all the time, as well as improving on the drivers we already have. As we add more libraries and update current ones, you can keep up with all the changes right here!

For the latest libraries, download the [Adafruit CircuitPython Library Bundle](https://circuitpython.org/libraries). For the latest community contributed libraries, download the [CircuitPython Community Bundle](https://github.com/adafruit/CircuitPython_Community_Bundle/releases).

If you'd like to contribute, CircuitPython libraries are a great place to start. Have an idea for a new driver? File an issue on [CircuitPython](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/issues)! Have you written a library you'd like to make available? Submit it to the [CircuitPython Community Bundle](https://github.com/adafruit/CircuitPython_Community_Bundle). Interested in helping with current libraries? Check out the [CircuitPython.org Contributing page](https://circuitpython.org/contributing). We've included open pull requests and issues from the libraries, and details about repo-level issues that need to be addressed. We have a guide on [contributing to CircuitPython with Git and GitHub](https://learn.adafruit.com/contribute-to-circuitpython-with-git-and-github) if you need help getting started. You can also find us in the #circuitpython channels on the [Adafruit Discord](https://adafru.it/discord).

You can check out this [list of all the Adafruit CircuitPython libraries and drivers available](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_Bundle/blob/master/circuitpython_library_list.md). 

The current number of CircuitPython libraries is **366**!

## What’s the team up to this week?

What is the team up to this week? Let’s check in!

**Dan**

I'm adding the ability to preserve the state of pins when entering deep sleep in CircuitPython. This will allow keeping devices powered up, maintaining static signaling on pins, and the like.

**Kattni**

This week I continued work on the WiFi Mailbox Notifier guide. I also continued to run into bugs and hardware issues. So it hasn't been the smoothest experience. The guide is coming along. It's a very simple build with a very useful result, so if you're interested in knowing when you have new mail, check out this guide once it's published.

**Melissa**

[![Melissa](../assets/20220913/20220913melissa.jpg)](https://learn.adafruit.com/getting-started-with-web-workflow-using-the-code-editor)

This past week I wrote up a learn guide called [CircuitPython Web Workflow Code Editor Quick Start](https://learn.adafruit.com/getting-started-with-web-workflow-using-the-code-editor). The guide covers getting most features on all the Web Workflow features I've added over the past couple of months. The guide includes a handy script I came up with to allow switching between multiple WiFi networks while USB Mass Storage is disabled.

**Tim**

This week I created FlipDigit and FlipClock widget classes that make use of pre-generated spritesheets to show an animated flip clock style transition from one number to another with displayio. The Digit represents a single number that can flip and change between the numbers 0-9. The FlipClock holds 4 digits, and draws a colon between them. To serve as the first test program using these widgets I used the NTP library to create a flip clock that stays in sync with the real time that it fetched from the server.

## Call for help -- Translating CircuitPython is now easier than ever!

[![CircuitPython translation statistics on weblate](../assets/20220913/20220913weblate.jpg)](https://hosted.weblate.org/engage/circuitpython/)

One important feature of CircuitPython is translated control and error messages. With the help of fellow open source project [Weblate](https://weblate.org/), we're making it even easier to add or improve translations.
