## CircuitPython Project Bundle

When you get to the CircuitPython code section of an [Adafruit Learn Guide](https://learn.adafruit.com/), sometimes things can get a bit complicated. You not only have the code you need to upload to your device, but you likely also need to add some libraries that the code requires to run. This involved downloading all the libraries, digging through to find the ones you need, and copying them to your device. That was only the beginning on some projects, as those that include images and/or sound files required further downloading and copying of files. But, not anymore!

Now, with Project Bundles, you can download all the necessary code, libraries and, if needed, asset files with one click! We automatically check which libraries are required for the project and bundle them up for you. No mnore digging through a huge list of libraries to find the ones you need, or fiddling with looking for other files or dependencies. Download the Project Bundle, copy the contents to your device, and your code will simply work. We wanted to make this the easiest way to get a project working, regardless of whether you're a beginner or an expert. We'll also be adding this feature to popular IDEs as an add-on. Try it out with any Circuit Python guide on the Adafruit Learning System. Just look for the ‘Download Project Bundle’ button on the code page. 

**To download and use a Project Bundle:**

In the Learning System - above any embedded code in a guide in the Adafruit Learn System, you’ll find a Download Project Bundle button.

[![Project Bundle download button](../assets/20210427/20210427pblink.jpg)](https://learn.adafruit.com/)

Click the button to download the Project Bundle zip.

[![Project Bundle zip downloaded](../assets/20210427/20210427pbzipfile.jpg)](https://learn.adafruit.com/)

Open the Project Bundle zip to find the example code, all necessary libraries, and, if available, any images, sounds, etc.

[![Project Bundle unzipped](../assets/20210427/20210427pbdownload.jpg)](https://learn.adafruit.com/)

Simply copy all the files over to your CIRCUITPY drive, and you’re ready to go!

If you run into any problems or bugs, or would like to submit feedback, please file an issue on the [Adafruit Learning System Guides GitHub repo](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_Learning_System_Guides/issues).

## CircuitPython Libraries!

[![CircuitPython Libraries](../assets/20210427/blinka.png)](https://circuitpython.org/libraries)

CircuitPython support for hardware continues to grow. We are adding support for new sensors and breakouts all the time, as well as improving on the drivers we already have. As we add more libraries and update current ones, you can keep up with all the changes right here!

For the latest libraries, download the [Adafruit CircuitPython Library Bundle](https://circuitpython.org/libraries). For the latest community contributed libraries, download the [CircuitPython Community Bundle](https://github.com/adafruit/CircuitPython_Community_Bundle/releases).

If you'd like to contribute, CircuitPython libraries are a great place to start. Have an idea for a new driver? File an issue on [CircuitPython](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/issues)! Have you written a library you'd like to make available? Submit it to the [CircuitPython Community Bundle](https://github.com/adafruit/CircuitPython_Community_Bundle). Interested in helping with current libraries? Check out the [CircuitPython.org Contributing page](https://circuitpython.org/contributing). We've included open pull requests and issues from the libraries, and details about repo-level issues that need to be addressed. We have a guide on [contributing to CircuitPython with Git and Github](https://learn.adafruit.com/contribute-to-circuitpython-with-git-and-github) if you need help getting started. You can also find us in the #circuitpython channel on the [Adafruit Discord](https://adafru.it/discord).

You can check out this [list of all the Adafruit CircuitPython libraries and drivers available](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_Bundle/blob/master/circuitpython_library_list.md). 

The current number of CircuitPython libraries is **312**!

## What’s the team up to this week?

What is the team up to this week? Let’s check in!

**Dan**

I'm continuing to work on dynamic USB descriptors. I've written a lot of the code, and am finishing up, doing HID devices. I hope that this capability will be compact enough that it can fit even on our smallest boards.

**Jeff**

I've been working on CircuitPython support for "parallel capture" cameras, starting with the OV7670.  This inexpensive camera can be purchased from the usual website that sells everything, and modified to plug in to a Grand Central.  Based on code written by Phil B, I've created a core driver for "parallel capture" on the SAM D51 microcontrollers including the GrandCentral, as well as a Python library to initialize the OV7670 camera.

**Kattni**

This week I published the QT Py RP2040 and the Neo Trinkey guides, updated the SHT31-D and HTU21-F breakout guides for the STEMMA QT revisions, and helped with the Adafruit FunHouse guide. I also uploaded a number of PCB files to GitHub based on request.

I updated the script that circuitpython.org uses to generate the /contributing page as well. There had been updates to the script, but they had not been applied to the rendered pages yet. This means the information available on that page is more up to date now.

I wrote a README to include in the new Adafruit Learn System Project Bundles that explains how the bundle works, what to do with it, and includes a link to where it was downloaded from and the date it was downloaded.

I finally have examples of templates! The Neo Trinkey guide includes the [NeoPixel Blink template](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-neo-trinkey/neopixel-blink). It looks on this end like a normal guide page. But on the editor end, most of the page is immutable, and the author adds the image and the code. That means a lot less work in the future, but more importantly, provides a much more consistent experience across guides!

**Lucian**

This past week I've been working on the RP2040 alarm system, starting with TimeAlarm, which makes use of the RTC to wake from light/deep sleep. Since the RP2040 currently uses the Timer peripheral for internal timekeeping, the RTC hasn't seen a lot of buildout, so I've been filling it out with some of the utility code in the STM32 port. The Raspberry Pi official libraries for sleep are still very much in the alpha stages, and I've mostly been working from the reference manual and trying different things out by hand to explore what isn't laid out in prior work.

I've also been working on finalizing the NRF52 and STM32 ports of Alarm, fixing various formatting issues and bugs that have been holding them back from being merged, so we can hopefully start getting everything back on the same track soon.

**Melissa**

This past week, I wrote the FunHouse product guide. In order to avoid needing to rewrite many copies of similar pages, I learn how to use a new feature of the learn guides called Template pages. These are basically regular guide pages with small sections to add sections in the middle of the page. The guide took a little longer to write than the typical product guide, but it should make writing guides in the future much easier. You can check out the FunHouse guide at https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-funhouse.

Another thing I did is I added a couple of different versions of the WiFi module to the PortalBase library. The different versions reflect the ESP32-S2 and AirLift WiFi coprocessor that are common on many of our boards. This will make adding similar boards even easier in the future as well as making maintenance of the WiFi modules much easier. I have already updated the FunHouse and MagTag libraries to make use of the changes and will update the PyPortal and MatrixPortal libraries soon.

**Scott**

Since we're at the start of 7.x work, I've begun merging in changes from upstream MicroPython. My brain is completely swamped with that work so I can't think about much else. My approach is to merge in each release from MicroPython. So, we're starting with ~1.9.4 and MicroPython just released 1.15. So, we've got 1.10, 1.11, 1.12, 1.13, 1.14 and 1.15 to merge in. I'm nearly done with 1.10 and have started with the 1.11 merge. I'm hoping the later versions will be easier merges because MicroPython has started releasing more frequently (and therefore fewer changes.)
