Welcome to the latest Python on Microcontrollers newsletter! The Raspberry Pi Pico W excitement is calming down as there are a number of Python events like EuroPython just concluded. The community is looking to keep cool in the Northern hemisphere with record heat and building a number of projects related to that while looking to stay cool indoors. Do you have news? Send it into cpnews(at)adafruit(dot)com for consideration for upcoming issues.

We're on [Discord](https://discord.gg/HYqvREz), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/search?q=circuitpython&src=typed_query&f=live), and for past newsletters - [view them all here](https://www.adafruitdaily.com/category/circuitpython/).

## What’s the team up to this week?

What is the team up to this week? Let’s check in!

**Jeff**

Building on a large amount of work by Dan, I was able to find one big remaining problem with the new ESP32 port. Now, a lot of things work with the Adafruit Feather ESP32 V2 and the experimental version of CircuitPython, and I'll be fixing more as the week continues. As of now it's possible to connect with a terminal program or Thonny and do a lot of basic tasks including I2C, `digitalio`, and `analogio`!

**Kattni**

This past week has been focussed on non-CircuitPython related work. I have been helping out with adding WipperSnapper Setup and Usage pages to supported board guides. I've found bugs both in the background and the UI (all of which have been fixed!). I've also helped out with making a Usage template that works with the rest of the boards (the first two were for Feather and QT Py). I'll be continuing to work on that until I get through the rest of the boards on my list.

**Melissa**

This last week, I spent a lot of the time learning and adding some GitHub Actions to the WipperSnapper code base that was able to look at some JSON files to get some parameters for different boards and process the board differently. This was to fix an issue where the separate files were having trouble being written to board, but a combined file worked fine.

**Tim**

I continued worked on the Octopus Game & Watch game and the guide covering it. I also cleaned up the web workflow edit page implementation and submitted a PR with it. I've received and started looking into an ESP32-S3 based tablet device made by a community member, I'll be trying to solve a few issues and get it into a state where it could be PR'd to add to CircuitPython core. First step is trying to get the branch for it building in my local environment.

**Scott**

This week I've wrapped up WebSocket serial support. It's working pretty well, even on mobile. After that, I've been working on making the web workflow on boards without displays. Thanks to RetiredWizard for helping debug this. I've got a PR out to fix it but they are still seeing some issues (though it's better than what is checked in now I think.) I'm also working on supporting changing the port of the HTTP server so that user code can use 80. While I was at it, I also tweaked the start up code so it doesn't require a full-reset for password and port changes to take effect. It's all getting close! It's also very cool to see on the ESP32.

This week I worked on the NAU7802 Food Scale project. It was a fun challenge to learn about and code up a reliable calibration process for the sensor in CircuitPython. Next, I'll be turning it into an IoT with Azure. I think it will be good to show an inventory IoT project. I'm also working on documenting some new STEMMA boards, like the [LSM6DS3TR-C accelerometer](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-lsm6ds3tr-c-6-dof-accel-gyro-imu).
