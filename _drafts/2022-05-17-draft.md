## Project of the Week: A 3D Printed Stellated Dodecahedron Lit by CircuitPython

[![Stellated Dodecahedron](../assets/20220517/20220517deb.gif)](https://twitter.com/GeekMomProjects/status/1524843805274275840)

A stellated dodecahedron 3D printed and lit with NeoPixels and CircuitPython by GeekMomProjects - [Twitter](https://twitter.com/GeekMomProjects/status/1524843805274275840).

> Printed a stellated dodecahedron with the folding 3D print technique I got from @SignalSkew. Each face prints flat and edges fold to the dihedral angle to form the polyhedron. Sides (and obligatory addressable LED string) are held in place with small zip ties. It's printed in clear PETG at 0.2 mm layer height. Wall thickness 1.5mm. Joined edges are 0.4mm thick. I printed it first with PLA, but flexing the edges more than a dozen or so times while inserting the LEDs broke them. PETG is sturdier.

## New Boards Supported by CircuitPython

The number of supported microcontrollers and Single Board Computers (SBC) grows every week. This section outlines which boards have been included in CircuitPython or added to [CircuitPython.org](https://circuitpython.org/).

This week, there were (#/no) new boards added!

- [Board name](url)
- [Board name](url)

*Note: For non-Adafruit boards, please use the support forums of the board manufacturer for assistance, as Adafruit does not have the hardware to assist in troubleshooting.*

Looking to add a new board to CircuitPython? It's highly encouraged! Adafruit has four guides to help you do so:

- [How to Add a New Board to CircuitPython](https://learn.adafruit.com/how-to-add-a-new-board-to-circuitpython/overview)

## CircuitPython Libraries!

[![CircuitPython Libraries](../assets/20220517/blinka.png)](https://circuitpython.org/libraries)

CircuitPython support for hardware continues to grow. We are adding support for new sensors and breakouts all the time, as well as improving on the drivers we already have. As we add more libraries and update current ones, you can keep up with all the changes right here!

For the latest libraries, download the [Adafruit CircuitPython Library Bundle](https://circuitpython.org/libraries). For the latest community contributed libraries, download the [CircuitPython Community Bundle](https://github.com/adafruit/CircuitPython_Community_Bundle/releases).

If you'd like to contribute, CircuitPython libraries are a great place to start. Have an idea for a new driver? File an issue on [CircuitPython](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/issues)! Have you written a library you'd like to make available? Submit it to the [CircuitPython Community Bundle](https://github.com/adafruit/CircuitPython_Community_Bundle). Interested in helping with current libraries? Check out the [CircuitPython.org Contributing page](https://circuitpython.org/contributing). We've included open pull requests and issues from the libraries, and details about repo-level issues that need to be addressed. We have a guide on [contributing to CircuitPython with Git and GitHub](https://learn.adafruit.com/contribute-to-circuitpython-with-git-and-github) if you need help getting started. You can also find us in the #circuitpython channels on the [Adafruit Discord](https://adafru.it/discord).

You can check out this [list of all the Adafruit CircuitPython libraries and drivers available](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_Bundle/blob/master/circuitpython_library_list.md). 

The current number of CircuitPython libraries is **356**!

## What’s the team up to this week?

What is the team up to this week? Let’s check in!

**Dan**

I'm continuing to work on ESP32-nn I2C issues. I worked with an Espressif engineer, who gave me a fix for one bug, which we've incorporated into our builds. There is another bug appearing only on ESP32-S3, and I've reproduced that in a simple test program outside of CircuitPython and passed on the information.

We should be able to publish the first release candidate for CircuitPython 7.3.0 soon. The final pull requests are being finished.

**Jeff**

[![Jeff](../assets/20220517/20220517jeff.gif)](https://circuitpython.org/)

Check out the updated guide on using the RP2040's PIO peripheral with CircuitPython: https://learn.adafruit.com/intro-to-rp2040-pio-with-circuitpython/overview

I started out adding support for an arbitrary number of servo motors with PWM, to work with Pimoroni's Servo 2040 board. But this work opened up my inner eye and let me grasp other ways to use PIO to control LEDs & NeoPixels in the background while CircuitPython code keeps on chugging.

I won't be doing weekly updates for a bit, as I'm taking a much needed break. See you in July!

**Kattni**

I'm still settling in from PyCon 2022. Tim put together the numbers from the outcome of the sprints; we had 14 PRs from 8 authors. As I said before, it was an amazing experience, and it was great to see so many new contributors join us for the sprints!

I spent this week getting caught up on guide feedback (down to 0!), and testing PyLeap features with CircuitPython updates. I also taught Liz how to create Fritzing objects. She learned quickly, as usual, and even though she encountered issues (as is expected with Fritzing object creation), she has already done a few on her own!

I also started on a new guide page in the Welcome to CircuitPython guide that explains the three different ways CircuitPython libraries can be placed on or accessed from a microcontroller. We get questions about this regularly, so folks are definitely interested in the content. This page will be a detailed explanation of .mpy files, .py files, and frozen modules in CircuitPython. If you want more information on this, keep an eye out for this new page!

**Melissa**

This past week, after arriving back safely from PyCon, I worked on a bunch of small GitHub issues and reviewed some outstanding Pull Requests. After that, I wrote up [a guide](https://learn.adafruit.com/editing-circuitpython-on-ios-with-runestone/) on using [Runestone](https://runestone.app/) to edit CircuitPython code on iOS devices. One of the things that came out of that guide was realizing we needed the bootloaders of devices to advertise they only used 100ma so that the device wouldn't stop working. Once that was finished, I started working on the final eInk guide for the 2.7" ePaper displays.

**Tim**

I tested out a PR for RFM9x Radios, and in doing so uncovered a potential issue when using them along with SDCards on the same SPI bus. Another one of the larger PRs that I tested this week was for the EMC2101 fan controller breakout. I've used both of these devices before but only briefly so it was a fun to get them set back up and try out the examples and other code on them. My TabLayout displayio widget was merged into the DisplayIO_Layout library this week and I've been helping community member PaulSK prepare some additional examples for it that they worked on. I'll be continuing to build out more advanced examples that use it during Deep Dive this week and throughout the upcoming weekend.

**Scott**

This week I'm booting back up after six weeks of paternity leave. I've gotten through email and given up on past chats. So, I'm onto some bug fixes. First on my list is fixing CircuitPython's reload interaction with transferring files over BLE. Next I'll be updating the NTP library to actually use NTP to fetch the time. Currently it relies on ESP32SPI to get the time.

**Liz**

This week I wrapped up the Laser Harp guide. I'm really pleased with how it turned out. I was able to expand on it a bit and add some more features, such as multiple synth instruments depending on the height that you're playing at, pitchbend and volume control. I'm going to be doing some testing to ensure that the project can also be built with a Feather RP2040 since I ran into some I2C mux issues with the board originally, but in the depths of project assembly it was hard to tell whether it was something on my end or something funkier. I also wrote some code for JP's Raspberry Pi in stock alarm. 

Kattni has shown me how to create Fritzing objects (thanks Kattni!) so I've been working on a few to become familiar with it. So far it's going pretty well. This week I'll be continuing with Fritzing things, writing up a guide for the CP2102N and working on a new project: wireless LED maracas.
