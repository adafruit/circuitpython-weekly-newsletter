## October is Open Hardware Month

[![Open Hardware Month](../assets/20231002/20231002ohm.jpg)](https://ohm.oshwa.org/)

October is Open Hardware Month! Join [OSHWA](https://www.oshwa.org/) by [Certifying](https://certification.oshwa.org/) hardware as open source, becoming a member, or – where it is safe due to the pandemic – hosting a small event. OSHWA is providing resources and asking the community to host small, local events (if it’s safe) in the name of open source hardware - [OSHWA](https://ohm.oshwa.org/).

[![Open Hardware Month: Certification Chat](../assets/20231002/20231002hc.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/live/GXs-nZ3JXy8?feature=shared)

hackster.io welcomes Sid Drmay to discuss everything the Open Source Hardware Association (OSHWA) is planning for Open Hardware Month! Returning guest Ayesha Iftiqhar-Wilson joins the conversation as Alex Glow explore the process of documenting your projects on the way to OSHWA certification. Now's the perfect time to certify your own project, become a member of OSHWA, or get involved in other ways - [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/live/GXs-nZ3JXy8?feature=shared).

## LibrePCB 1.0 Announced

[![LibrePCB 1.0](../assets/20231002/20231002libre.gif)](https://librepcb.org/blog/2023-09-24_release_1.0.0/)

The [1.0 version](https://librepcb.org/blog/2023-09-24_release_1.0.0/) of the [LibrePCB](https://librepcb.org/) "free, cross-platform, easy-to-use electronic design automation suite to draw schematics and design printed circuit boards" is out. A grant this year has helped spur development of the tool with the focus for the release being adding features that were needed so that "there should be no show stopper anymore which prevents you from using LibrePCB for more complex PCB (printed circuit board) designs". New features include a 3D viewer and export format for working with designs in a mechanical computer aided design (CAD) tool, support for manufacturer part number (MFN) management, and lots of board editor features such as thermal relief pads in planes, blind & buried vias, keepout zones, and more - [LibrePCB](https://librepcb.org/blog/2023-09-24_release_1.0.0/) and [lwn.net](https://lwn.net/Articles/945519/).

Meet Karma, GeekMomProjects new colorful companion bot designed in collaboration with @odd_jayy. She (she's definitely a girl, because Karma's a bitch) sits on my shoulders and responds to faces and to touch. One ear lights blue, depending on which side of midline she sees the closest face. Her head moves to track it too, though that part needs work. There is a small ($10!) "person" sensor in her head that locates face bounding boxes, plus a capacitive touch sensor that changes animation patterns along her back ridge when petted - [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/reel/Cxgaq96Sbgj/).

## New Boards Supported by CircuitPython

The number of supported microcontrollers and Single Board Computers (SBC) grows every week. This section outlines which boards have been included in CircuitPython or added to [CircuitPython.org](https://circuitpython.org/).

This week there were no new boards, but several are in development.

*Note: For non-Adafruit boards, please use the support forums of the board manufacturer for assistance, as Adafruit does not have the hardware to assist in troubleshooting.*

Looking to add a new board to CircuitPython? It's highly encouraged! Adafruit has four guides to help you do so:

- [How to Add a New Board to CircuitPython](https://learn.adafruit.com/how-to-add-a-new-board-to-circuitpython/overview)
- [How to add a New Board to the circuitpython.org website](https://learn.adafruit.com/how-to-add-a-new-board-to-the-circuitpython-org-website)

## What’s the CircuitPython team up to this week?

What is the team up to this week? Let’s check in!

**Dan**

I continued working on the MicroPython V1.20.0 merge into CircuitPython. Thanks to Jeff who got mpy-cross and the unix port building. I am starting with Trinket M0 and I am correcting things to make it build, and then will do the same for other representative boards. We also have various test failures to address.

I also spent some time trying to track down why the NINA-FW firmware does not work with a particular certificate chain. I did not yet find a cause. The same chain also fails on the Arduino version of NINA-FW. It works fine with the native WiFi module in CircuitPython on Espressif boards. 

**Melissa**

[![Melissa](../assets/20231002/20231002melissa.jpg)](https://www.circuitpython.org/)

This past week I've been working on revamping [Blinka's displayio implementation](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_Blinka_Displayio) and added grayscale and monochrome screen support. This also updates much of the underlying logic to be much more in line with CircuitPython's `displayio` implementation. It also adds dirty rectangle tracking so it draws more efficiently and it has been updated to use CircuitPython's font.

**Tim**

This week I've been working on a tool that can make releases on GitHub for all CircuitPython libraries that have newer commits than the most recent release. I used it initially to make releases for the patch that was pushed out last week. Next I'll work on adding some additional review steps and potentially more capabilities like allowing the user to input a tag name rather than using the auto-generated one.

**Jeff**

Last week, I continued to divide my time between further improvements to the dot clock TFT initialization code and the MicroPython 1.20 merge. I also refined the [CircuitPython firmware for the Unicomp Mini M Keyboard](https://adafruit-playground.com/u/jepler/pages/unicomp-mini-m-with-circuitpython). I'm taking some time off so this will be my last update for a few weeks! See you in November.

**Scott**

Last week I merged in the updates for [ESP IDF 5.0](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/pull/8411) and [5.1](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/pull/8424). Now, I'm fixing bugs we've found. :-) First, thanks to [@bill88t who noticed ESP32 was broken after the 5.1 update](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/issues/8429). I just [merged in a fix](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/pull/8435) for that. Second, the original 5.0 merge disabled `rgbmatrix` so I'm working to re-enable it but finding some crashes that need fixing too.

**Liz**

This week I worked on the guide for the [HUSB238 breakout](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-husb238-usb-type-c-power-delivery-breakout). This breakout lets you request specific voltages from a USB C PD adapter. I'm hoping to use this breakout to convert some gear I have to use USB C for power rather than random wall wart DC power.
