Welcome to the latest Python on Microcontrollers newsletter, brought you by the community! We're on [Discord](https://discord.gg/HYqvREz), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/search?q=circuitpython&src=typed_query&f=live), and for past newsletters - [view them all here](https://www.adafruitdaily.com/category/circuitpython/). If you're reading this on the web, [subscribe here](https://www.adafruitdaily.com/). Let's get started!

## Tom's Hardware Best RP2040 Boards 2021

[![Best RP2040 Boards](../assets/20210615/20210615top.jpg)](https://www.tomshardware.com/best-picks/best-rp2040-boards)

While Raspberry Pi has its own RP2040-powered board in the Raspberry Pi Pico, there are now more than a dozen, third-party solutions that offer improvements which range from smaller sizes to built-in Wi-Fi, more storage or a lot of additional outputs. There are even RP2040-powered keypads.

> To help you choose, we‚Äôve listed the best RP2040 boards below. These boards can be used for everything from general learning to building Wi-Fi connected robots to implementing basic A.I. 

Adafruit has three of the 10 boards! - [Tom's Hardware](https://www.tomshardware.com/best-picks/best-rp2040-boards).

## 2021 - The Year Windows Became a First Class Python Development Environment

[![Windows Powershell](../assets/20210615/20210615win.jpg)](https://www.feoh.org/2021-the-year-windows-became-a-first-class-python-development-environment.html)

> I felt so badly burned by Apple‚Äôs laptop hardware design decisions of a few years ago that I‚Äôve rather fallen out of love with that platform for my personal work. My first choice was the Linux desktop, and after months of struggling, instability and accessibility issues I‚Äôll admit I‚Äôve been looking for stable, solid alternatives that are also powerful enough to get the job done and maybe even have something new to offer... If you‚Äôve tangoed with Windows in the past, and found yourself struggling against its rather byzantine UI, I‚Äôd urge you to read on and see if maybe it‚Äôs not time for another careful look.

## CircuitPython Project Bundle

[![BundleFly](../assets/20210615/20210615bundlefly.jpg)](https://learn.adafruit.com/)

When you get to the CircuitPython code section of an [Adafruit Learn Guide](https://learn.adafruit.com/), sometimes things can get a bit complicated. You not only have the code you need to upload to your device, but you likely also need to add some libraries that the code requires to run. This involved downloading all the libraries, digging through to find the ones you need, and copying them to your device. That was only the beginning on some projects, as those that include images and/or sound files required further downloading and copying of files. But, not anymore!

Now, with Project Bundles, you can download all the necessary code, libraries and, if needed, asset files with one click! We automatically check which libraries are required for the project and bundle them up for you. No more digging through a huge list of libraries to find the ones you need, or fiddling with looking for other files or dependencies. Download the Project Bundle, copy the contents to your device, and your code will simply work. We wanted to make this the easiest way to get a project working, regardless of whether you're a beginner or an expert. We'll also be adding this feature to popular IDEs as an add-on. Try it out with any Circuit Python guide on the Adafruit Learning System. Just look for the ‚ÄòDownload Project Bundle‚Äô button on the code page. 

**To download and use a Project Bundle:**

In the Learning System - above any embedded code in a guide in the Adafruit Learn System, you‚Äôll find a Download Project Bundle button.

[![Project Bundle download button](../assets/20210615/20210615pblink.jpg)](https://learn.adafruit.com/)

Click the button to download the Project Bundle zip.

[![Project Bundle zip downloaded](../assets/20210615/20210615pbzipfile.jpg)](https://learn.adafruit.com/)

Open the Project Bundle zip to find the example code, all necessary libraries, and, if available, any images, sounds, etc.

[![Project Bundle unzipped](../assets/20210615/20210615pbdownload.jpg)](https://learn.adafruit.com/)

Simply copy all the files over to your CIRCUITPY drive, and you‚Äôre ready to go!

If you run into any problems or bugs, or would like to submit feedback, please file an issue on the [Adafruit Learning System Guides GitHub repo](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_Learning_System_Guides/issues).

## CircuitPython Libraries!

[![CircuitPython Libraries](../assets/20210615/blinka.png)](https://circuitpython.org/libraries)

CircuitPython support for hardware continues to grow. We are adding support for new sensors and breakouts all the time, as well as improving on the drivers we already have. As we add more libraries and update current ones, you can keep up with all the changes right here!

For the latest libraries, download the [Adafruit CircuitPython Library Bundle](https://circuitpython.org/libraries). For the latest community contributed libraries, download the [CircuitPython Community Bundle](https://github.com/adafruit/CircuitPython_Community_Bundle/releases).

If you'd like to contribute, CircuitPython libraries are a great place to start. Have an idea for a new driver? File an issue on [CircuitPython](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/issues)! Have you written a library you'd like to make available? Submit it to the [CircuitPython Community Bundle](https://github.com/adafruit/CircuitPython_Community_Bundle). Interested in helping with current libraries? Check out the [CircuitPython.org Contributing page](https://circuitpython.org/contributing). We've included open pull requests and issues from the libraries, and details about repo-level issues that need to be addressed. We have a guide on [contributing to CircuitPython with Git and Github](https://learn.adafruit.com/contribute-to-circuitpython-with-git-and-github) if you need help getting started. You can also find us in the #circuitpython channel on the [Adafruit Discord](https://adafru.it/discord).

## What‚Äôs the team up to this week?

What is the team up to this week? Let‚Äôs check in!

**Dan**

I released CircuitPython 7.0.0-alpha.3 last week. This the first 7.0.0 release that's been listed on [circuitpython.org](https://circuitpython.org), even though the tag is "alpha.3".

I'm continuing to work on keypad scanning support. I was on vacation for part of the past week, but will finish the initial support soon.

**Jeff**

I've continued working on ParallelImageCapture (camera) support for ESP32-S2, and have added a Pull Request to add this feature to CircuitPython.  So far, it works with the OV7670 camera, like SAMD51 and RP2040 do.

On the way, I added a board definition for the second (and current) version of the Kaluga development board, v1.3.  This version has a few pinout modifications that are supposed to let the camera work better; I also learned that, on either version, the camera module can interfere with the remote debugging feature, which creates challenges. If you have a Kaluga, check the silk screen on the bottom to find out which version it is.

Finally, while I haven't filed a pull request about it yet, I discovered and fixed a small bug in CircuitPython that could trigger a crash but only with a custom "debug build".

**Kattni**

This week we moved the rest of the CircuitPython GitHub repositories to the `main` default branch. This is an important change for many reasons. It affects contributors - the easiest solution is to delete your fork and clone, and start with a fresh fork and clone.

I also completed a massive list of miscellaneous things that came up over the weekend and throughout the week, including adding the 7.x bundle to circuitpython.org, adding a NeoPixel example to the Rotary QT Trinkey guide and more.

I started the Slider Trinkey guide and the QTRP2040 guide. Look for the Slider Trinkey guide soon, and the QTRP2040 guide not long after.

**Lucian**

While I took a week off this past week, I've most recently been working on the documentation for the sleep modes, paired with updates to the new RP2040 alarm module. I finally got a Nordic PPK2 testing board in to assist with power analysis, which has been out of stock all spring and just finally came back in with the online retailers. It's been nice to verify the power savings from the sleep modes concretely - I'm excited to revive some personal datalogging projects with Circuitpython now that I can get months of battery life per AA battery.

**Melissa**

This past week I finished working on a new guide that uses Voice2JSON to implement a very customizable Voice Assistant. Voice2JSON allows for speech recognition that runs directly on your device without the need to go out to the internet to recognize what you are saying. You can check out the guide at https://learn.adafruit.com/edge-speech-recognition-with-voice2json.

**Scott**

This week I've been bug hunting issues with the BLE workflow in the core. At this point, I think the major issues have been ironed out. Most of the issues were surrounding BLE encryption and bonding. (Bonding is the process of remembering the security keys to encrypt the connection for use in reconnecting.) Once bonded, devices may choose to broadcast an encrypted version of its device ID which reduces the ease of tracking as well. With these changes, I hope it'll be solid enough for testing with the app while I'm on vacation for next week (back June 21st).
