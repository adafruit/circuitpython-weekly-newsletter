## MIDI for Makers Guide

[![MIDI for Makers](../assets/20220308/20220308midimakers.jpg)](https://learn.adafruit.com/midi-for-makers)

Liz Clark has a new guide with everything to get you started with your own MIDI projects. You can focus on building rather than searching everywhere on the internet. - [Adafruit Learning System](https://learn.adafruit.com/midi-for-makers).

> Whether you're a classically trained pianist or a hobbyist who thinks synths sound really cool, the allure of DIY MIDI projects are incredibly tempting. It can be hard to know how to get started though. What board should you use? How does the code work? What even is MIDI?

## CircuitPython Deep Dive Stream and Guest Host

## Dublin Linux Developer meetup with Adafruit March 5th

[![Dublin Linux Developer online meetup with Adafruit](../assets/20220308/20220308dublin.jpg)](https://blog.adafruit.com/2022/03/02/dublin-linux-developer-online-meetup-with-adafruit-march-5th-linux-adafruit-circuitpython/)

Dublin Linux Developers met online with Jeff Epler and Melissa LeBlanc-Williams from Adafruit onMarch 5th - [Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/Dublin-Linux-Developers/events/283916463/) and [Adafruit Blog](https://blog.adafruit.com/2022/03/02/dublin-linux-developer-online-meetup-with-adafruit-march-5th-linux-adafruit-circuitpython/).

Jeff's presentation was on "From Zero to CircuitPython". CircuitPython is an embedded implementation of the Python language, a friendly fork of MicroPython primarily developed by Adafruit and designed to simplify experimenting and learning to code on low-cost microcontroller boards. Jeff demoed the process from receiving a factory fresh Adafruit board to showing the Dublin forecast downloaded over WiFi on the board's built-in TFT display. Some prior familiarity with Python and JSON is helpful, but not essential. Github gist of the code written during the session and other links will be provided.

Melissa's presentation was “Getting to Blinky with Blinka” and included an overview of how easy it is to get up and running with Adafruit Blinka on a Raspberry Pi. She showed off a couple of her other projects including a scrolling message board that can easily be scripted using Python and TI calculator with a fully working Raspberry Pi Zero inside. Both projects are running Linux as the base OS. 

*Note: apologies this wasn't in last week's issue. Video forthcoming.*

## What’s the team up to this week?

What is the team up to this week? Let’s check in!

**Dan**

I released CircuitPython 7.2.0 final about ten days before this issue of the newsletter is published. We have more bugs to fix soon for 7.2.1 or 7.3.0. I'm working on several of these bugs.

I finished some shuffling of Python annotation types from the circuitpython source tree to the `circuitpython_typing` library. The types are used for generating stubs, and are also part of the documentation for core CircuitPython. Now we have a central place for adding new annotation types.

**Jeff**

For testing purposes, I've interfaced a Feather RP2040 to an Apple 2 floppy drive. Using CircuitPython, it's possible to position the read/write head, and obtain flux information from the floppy using the PIO peripheral. This just for experimental purposes, you can find the code [in a github gist](https://gist.github.com/jepler/95cd021e60b354f388298b573d725a69).

I've also tried reading and writing Apple II floppy images with a PC drive, contributing some pull requests to FluxEngine in the process ([1](https://github.com/davidgiven/fluxengine/pull/480), [2](https://github.com/davidgiven/fluxengine/pull/481)). However, a real Apple //e still can't reliably read the disk images I create.

**Kattni**

This week I did a bit of template work in both Arduino and CircuitPython. There are new templates for reading the LC709203 battery monitor on boards that have it, graphics test on board that have a built-in TFT, and using Adafruit IO to send and receive data.

I stumbled into a bug with `microcontroller.cpu.temperature` being called when WiFi is initiated, and went through a series of steps thinking I had fixed it, and it turns out, it's not something we can resolve. There's an issue filed on the ESP-IDF about the exact issue I was having, so it's at a lower level than CircuitPython. I filed an issue on the CircuitPython core so we have somewhere to link it to the IDF issue, and to track it.

**Melissa**

This past week I was out for part of the week due to health issues, but I did manage to get a little work done with updating Blinka to work with the Beaglebone Black on newer versions of the firmware. I also worked on preparing for a talk I gave this past weekend to the Dublin Linux Developers group.

**Tim**

I updated the PyPortal Winamp project to work with and fit nicely on the PyPortal Titano device. It also will now automatically generate a playlist by searching for mp3 files on the sdcard if the user didn't set up their playlist themselves.  I submitted a PR to CircuitPython core and nina-fw repositories to update the root certificates that are used when fetching data from the internet with CircuitPython. These allow us to fetch Webb Telescope data directly from a NASA provided server, so I updated that project to use the new data source and changed it to show the current data returned. 

I made a small update to some documentation of the wifi built-in module in the core. I also did some testing around and attempted to implement a solution to an issue occurring when sending USB HID events and updating large OnDiskBitmaps showing on the display.

**Scott**

This week I've been heads down on USB Host work. A week ago I decided that CircuitPython should provide a subset of the PyUSB API. This is the most commonly used CPython API used for interacting with USB devices. The benefit of copying the API is that we can port over existing code to CircuitPython as well. Making this decision got my brain unblocked.

The first platform I'm adding support for is the iMX RT (most popularly on the Teensy 4.x). The higher end versions of the iMX RT have two USB peripherals. One we can use for CIRCUITPY and one we can use for USB host. I've been getting code going there and revamping the serial debug setup a bit along the way.
