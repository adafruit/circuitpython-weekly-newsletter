## New Boards Supported by CircuitPython

The number of supported microcontrollers and Single Board Computers (SBC) grows every week. This section outlines which boards have been included in CircuitPython or added to [CircuitPython.org](https://circuitpython.org/).

This week, there were no new boards added but some are in development.

*Note: For non-Adafruit boards, please use the support forums of the board manufacturer for assistance, as Adafruit does not have the hardware to assist in troubleshooting.*

Looking to add a new board to CircuitPython? It's highly encouraged! Adafruit has four guides to help you do so:

- [How to Add a New Board to CircuitPython](https://learn.adafruit.com/how-to-add-a-new-board-to-circuitpython/overview)
- [How to add a New Board to the circuitpython.org website](https://learn.adafruit.com/how-to-add-a-new-board-to-the-circuitpython-org-website)
- [Adding a Single Board Computer to PlatformDetect for Blinka](https://learn.adafruit.com/adding-a-single-board-computer-to-platformdetect-for-blinka)

## CircuitPython Libraries!

[![CircuitPython Libraries](../assets/20230807/blinka.png)](https://circuitpython.org/libraries)

The CircuitPython library numbers are continually increasing, while existing ones continue to be updated. Here we provide library numbers and updates!

To get the latest Adafruit libraries, download the [Adafruit CircuitPython Library Bundle](https://circuitpython.org/libraries). To get the latest community contributed libraries, download the [CircuitPython Community Bundle](https://circuitpython.org/libraries).

If you'd like to contribute to the CircuitPython project on the Python side of things, the libraries are a great place to start. Check out the [CircuitPython.org Contributing page](https://circuitpython.org/contributing). If you're interested in reviewing, check out Open Pull Requests. If you'd like to contribute code or documentation, check out Open Issues. We have a guide on [contributing to CircuitPython with Git and GitHub](https://learn.adafruit.com/contribute-to-circuitpython-with-git-and-github), and you can find us in the #help-with-circuitpython and #circuitpython-dev channels on the [Adafruit Discord](https://adafru.it/discord).

You can check out this [list of all the Adafruit CircuitPython libraries and drivers available](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_Bundle/blob/master/circuitpython_library_list.md). 

The current number of CircuitPython libraries is **###**!

## What’s the CircuitPython team up to this week?

What is the team up to this week? Let’s check in!

**Dan**

[![title](../assets/20230807/20230807dan.jpg)](https://www.circuitpython.org/)

**Kattni**

This week I published the [ADXL343 + ADT7410 Sensor FeatherWing guide](https://learn.adafruit.com/adxl343-adt7410-sensor-featherwing). This one's a shorty because we have guides for both sensors already. If you're interested in the board details, check out the guide. If you're interested in code, check out the breakout guides linked within.

**Melissa**

This past week was a little shorter for me because I was out sick. I worked on the code for an upcoming learn guide that uses the MatrixPortal S3 to display a scrolling message board. I am impressed with the improved performance over the older MatrixPortal M4.

**Tim**

[![title](../assets/20230807/20230807tim.jpg)](https://www.circuitpython.org/)

**Jeff**

I've continued working on the prototype camera board, fixing up the animated GIF recorder, 'onionskin' still motion mode, image special effects, QR code scanner, and more.

I also did several other PRs in CircuitPython core, including fixes to the documentation build process to fix errors and keep up to date with changes at ReadTheDocs.

**Scott**

This week I'm continuing to debug USB host. I got a mass storage (MSC) demo working from the iMX RT but it failed on the RP2040. I've been trying to figure out why. Thach tried it and it worked just fine. So, it might have something to do with my particular setup. I've moved back to the higher level MSC support. I suspect that my usb drive isn't working due to a descriptor request in the middle of the MSC inquiry. I [streamed this work last week] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNmwbJ5EH7o).

**Liz**

This week I worked on the guide for the new [TSC2046 breakout](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-tsc2046-spi-resistive-touch-screen-controller). It is a SPI touch screen controller. For now there is only an Arduino library available, but a CircuitPython library should be available soon. When it is ready, I will update the guide to include it.

I also began working on a reimagining of the [MX MIDI guitar project](https://learn.adafruit.com/mx-midi-guitar). This was one of my first collaborations with Noe and it was a huge build with a lot of really fun features. However, it went live the week that most of the US went into lockdown for COVID-19 in March 2020, so it was hard to appreciate it once it was complete with everything going on. This new version will use `synthio`, some seesaw breakouts and a few other surprises we're hoping will work out.
