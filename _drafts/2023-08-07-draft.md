## Damien George, MicroPython Lead, on the Embedded.fm podcast

[![Embedded.fm](../assets/20230807/20230807fm.jpg)](https://embedded.fm/episodes/456)

Damien George spoke with embedded.fmabout developing with and for MicroPython while Elecia White tries not to spill all the secrets about her client.

To start at the beginning, you probably will want to check out [micropython.org](https://micropython.org/). Before listening to the show, you might read the [Wikipedia MicroPython entry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MicroPython) because they kind of start in the middle in the show.

You can find the code on [GitHub](github.com/micropython/micropython).

The PyBoard can be found on [store.micropython.org](https://store.micropython.org/). It is out of stock but lead time trends show parts may be available soon(ish) - [embedded.fm](https://embedded.fm/episodes/456).

## The New CircuitPython_IcePython Library Programs FPGAs

[![CircuitPython_IcePython](../assets/20230807/20230807fpga.jpg)](https://github.com/skerr92/Oakdevtech_CircuitPython_IcePython)

Usually to program an [iCE40 FPGA](https://www.crowdsupply.com/oak-dev-tech/icyblue-fpga-feather) from Lattice Semiconductor you need an FTDI chip or some other tool like OpenOCD and a device capable of communicating over SPI. This has changed now with IcePython, a driver library for CircuitPython which allows programming any iCE40 FPGA with a simple command.

Simply instantiate the IcePython class with a SPI object, a pin for chip select, a pin for FPGA reset, and a filename. Calling program_fpga() then programs the FPGA with the bin file provided - [GitHub](https://github.com/skerr92/Oakdevtech_CircuitPython_IcePython).

## MicroPython - Discontinuation of the In-house Library Prefix

[![MicroPython](../assets/20230807/20230807mp.png)](https://www.mikrocontroller.net/topic/557892)

As if in agreement, there is an [adjustment to MicroPython's naming structure](https://github.com/orgs/micropython/discussions/12078). The goal of the modification is better commonality with CPython  - [mikrocontroller.net](https://www.mikrocontroller.net/topic/557892).

- So in v1.21 (which will be released soon), all built-in modules have been renamed to match their CPython name -- os, sys, json, etc. The only exception is uctypes which is completely different to CPython's ctypes so it will keep its uctypes name. Additionally uasyncio and urequests have been renamed to asyncio and requests.
- There is a lot of existing code out there that use the u-prefix, e.g. import uos or import urequests so this will continue to work (for both C and Python modules). But please prefer to use just the non-u-prefixed name from now on.

## CircuitPython - A Swiss Army Knife

[![CircuitPython](../assets/20230807/20230807cp.jpg)](https://hackaday.com/2023/08/01/the-past-present-and-future-of-circuitpython/#comment-6668304)

The following is a comment left after last week's [Hack Chat on CircuitPython](https://hackaday.com/2023/08/01/the-past-present-and-future-of-circuitpython/#comment-6668304) - [Hackaday](https://hackaday.com/2023/08/01/the-past-present-and-future-of-circuitpython/#comment-6668304).

> "I used CircuitPython as a custom board testing framework for a fairly big multi-FPGA board (24 ASICs, 3 FPGAs, and a SAMD21 microcontroller used for overall control) used in a scientific experiment. It worked great – made board-level testing and adjustments easy, and then once things were obviously working we implemented a control packet framework, replaced the CircuitPython core with a simple Arduino framework firmware, and just… copied a ton of the CircuitPython code to Python and kept working.<br>&nbsp; <br>I *love* using Python for investigative-type testing of a board, or stuff you only need to do once, like board initialization. As someone who works with FPGAs frequently, it reminds me of using soft microcontrollers in an FPGA – when the control flow/logic is complicated and speed is unimportant, readability and speed of development is key."

## Project of the Week: TinkerMill's Electronic Access System

[![TinkerMill's Electronic Access System](../assets/20230807/20230807rfid.jpg)](https://www.sparkfun.com/news/7764)

TinkerMill is a makerspace local to SparkFun. TinkerAccess is an electronic access control system. Every member is issued a unique RFID key fob that they then use throughout the facility to open doors to certain areas. TinkerAccess limits access to certain various equipment until members have been properly trained on their use, as well as giving all members door access system to the building itself. The hardware is based on a Raspberry Pi with a custom designed daughtercard containing an RFID reader. The main code is written in Python. There is also a Raspberry Pi based server that hosts the SQLite database and web server interface for controlling individual user access to specific equipment or doors - [SparkFun](https://www.sparkfun.com/news/7764), [YouTube](https://youtu.be/jMcvGR5ooGo) and [GitHub](https://github.com/TinkerMill/tinkerAccess) (MIT License).

## What’s the CircuitPython team up to this week?

What is the team up to this week? Let’s check in!

**Dan**

I released CircuitPython 8.2.2 last week. The only change was replacing an expired SSL certificate that prevented access to Adafruit IO.

The certificate also had to be updated in the NINA-FW firmware, which is used for AirLift WiFi co-processors. However, we had trouble uploading the updated  version on AirLift boards like the MatrixPortal M4 or PyPortal. I debugged the problem, and thought that the process was interesting enough that I wrote it up as a blog post: ["Why Doesn't this Upload: A Debugging Tale"](https://blog.adafruit.com/2023/08/03/why-doesnt-this-upload-a-debugging-tale/).

**Kattni**

This week I published the [ADXL343 + ADT7410 Sensor FeatherWing guide](https://learn.adafruit.com/adxl343-adt7410-sensor-featherwing). This one's a shorty because we have guides for both sensors already. If you're interested in the board details, check out the guide. If you're interested in code, check out the breakout guides linked within.

**Melissa**

This past week was a little shorter for me because I was out sick. I worked on the code for an upcoming learn guide that uses the MatrixPortal S3 to display a scrolling message board. I am impressed with the improved performance over the older MatrixPortal M4.

**Tim**

I've been continuing to follow up on older PRs and move along or wrap up any that I can. I also made a sweep through all of the library 'good first issues' to remove the label from any that have too much scope or complexity for other reasons. Lastly I did some testing for XSS vulnerability within the HTTPServer library and submitted a PR to scrub POST'd data with the default usage in order to harden against it.

**Jeff**

I've continued working on the prototype camera board, fixing up the animated GIF recorder, 'onionskin' still motion mode, image special effects, QR code scanner, and more.

I also did several other PRs in CircuitPython core, including fixes to the documentation build process to fix errors and keep up to date with changes at ReadTheDocs.

**Scott**

This week I'm continuing to debug USB host. I got a mass storage (MSC) demo working from the iMX RT but it failed on the RP2040. I've been trying to figure out why. Thach tried it and it worked just fine. So, it might have something to do with my particular setup. I've moved back to the higher level MSC support. I suspect that my usb drive isn't working due to a descriptor request in the middle of the MSC inquiry. I [streamed this work last week] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNmwbJ5EH7o).

**Liz**

This week I worked on the guide for the new [TSC2046 breakout](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-tsc2046-spi-resistive-touch-screen-controller). It is a SPI touch screen controller. For now there is only an Arduino library available, but a CircuitPython library should be available soon. When it is ready, I will update the guide to include it.

I also began working on a reimagining of the [MX MIDI guitar project](https://learn.adafruit.com/mx-midi-guitar). This was one of my first collaborations with Noe and it was a huge build with a lot of really fun features. However, it went live the week that most of the US went into lockdown for COVID-19 in March 2020, so it was hard to appreciate it once it was complete with everything going on.
