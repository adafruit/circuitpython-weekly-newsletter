## CircuitPython Project Bundle

[![BundleFly](../assets/20211214/20211214bundlefly.jpg)](https://learn.adafruit.com/)

When you get to the CircuitPython code section of an [Adafruit Learn Guide](https://learn.adafruit.com/), sometimes things can get a bit complicated. You not only have the code you need to upload to your device, but you likely also need to add some libraries that the code requires to run. This involved downloading all the libraries, digging through to find the ones you need, and copying them to your device. That was only the beginning on some projects, as those that include images and/or sound files required further downloading and copying of files. But, not anymore!

Now, with Project Bundles, you can download all the necessary code, libraries and, if needed, asset files with one click! We automatically check which libraries are required for the project and bundle them up for you. No more digging through a huge list of libraries to find the ones you need, or fiddling with looking for other files or dependencies. Download the Project Bundle, copy the contents to your device, and your code will simply work. We wanted to make this the easiest way to get a project working, regardless of whether you're a beginner or an expert. We'll also be adding this feature to popular IDEs as an add-on. Try it out with any Circuit Python guide on the Adafruit Learning System. Just look for the ‘Download Project Bundle’ button on the code page. 

**To download and use a Project Bundle:**

In the Learning System - above any embedded code in a guide in the Adafruit Learn System, you’ll find a Download Project Bundle button.

[![Project Bundle download button](../assets/20211214/20211214pblink.jpg)](https://learn.adafruit.com/)

Click the button to download the Project Bundle zip.

[![Project Bundle zip downloaded](../assets/20211214/20211214pbzipfile.jpg)](https://learn.adafruit.com/)

Open the Project Bundle zip to find the example code, all necessary libraries, and, if available, any images, sounds, etc.

[![Project Bundle unzipped](../assets/20211214/20211214pbdownload.jpg)](https://learn.adafruit.com/)

Simply copy all the files over to your CIRCUITPY drive, and you’re ready to go!

If you run into any problems or bugs, or would like to submit feedback, please file an issue on the [Adafruit Learning System Guides GitHub repo](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_Learning_System_Guides/issues).

## CircuitPython Libraries!

[![CircuitPython Libraries](../assets/20211214/blinka.png)](https://circuitpython.org/libraries)

CircuitPython support for hardware continues to grow. We are adding support for new sensors and breakouts all the time, as well as improving on the drivers we already have. As we add more libraries and update current ones, you can keep up with all the changes right here!

For the latest libraries, download the [Adafruit CircuitPython Library Bundle](https://circuitpython.org/libraries). For the latest community contributed libraries, download the [CircuitPython Community Bundle](https://github.com/adafruit/CircuitPython_Community_Bundle/releases).

If you'd like to contribute, CircuitPython libraries are a great place to start. Have an idea for a new driver? File an issue on [CircuitPython](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/issues)! Have you written a library you'd like to make available? Submit it to the [CircuitPython Community Bundle](https://github.com/adafruit/CircuitPython_Community_Bundle). Interested in helping with current libraries? Check out the [CircuitPython.org Contributing page](https://circuitpython.org/contributing). We've included open pull requests and issues from the libraries, and details about repo-level issues that need to be addressed. We have a guide on [contributing to CircuitPython with Git and Github](https://learn.adafruit.com/contribute-to-circuitpython-with-git-and-github) if you need help getting started. You can also find us in the #circuitpython channel on the [Adafruit Discord](https://adafru.it/discord).

You can check out this [list of all the Adafruit CircuitPython libraries and drivers available](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_Bundle/blob/master/circuitpython_library_list.md).

## What’s the team up to this week?

What is the team up to this week? Let’s check in!

**Dan**

I have been fixing issues for the CircuitPython 7.1.0 release. I've fixed a `countio` issue on the RP2040, fixed `frequencyio.FrequencyIn` on SAMD51, fixed Airlift BLE support, and narrowed down an SD card problem that Jeff fixed: I had SD cards that triggered the problem, Jeff did not, and I was able to do a `git bisect` to determine which code was causing the issue.

**Jeff**

With a big assist from Dan I was able to fix a problem with SD cards that I had introduced when improving write speeds. This only affected users of 7.1 beta versions.

I also added board definition files for several esp32s3 development boards, which are now in the absolute latest builds.

**Kattni**

This week I published the core of the [KB2040 guide](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-kb2040). It still has a few things to add before it'll be completed, but if you're looking to get started with your board, check out the guide.

I added a `create_and_get_feed` function to the CircuitPython Adafruit IO library that combines the `get_feed` and `create_feed` functions. It allows you, in one line of code, to attempt to get a feed, and if it doesn't exist, create it and then get it. It eliminates the need for a `try`/`except` block in examples to do the same functionality.

Next up is the NeoSlider guide. Keep an eye out for that coming soon!

**Melissa**

This past week, I finished my Nunchuck Controlled Laser Cat Toy guide. I made a few tweaks to the source code to allow some cool this. For instance, since the project already had a PWM FeatherWing to control the servos, I updated it so it could change the brightness of the laser by pulsing the on/off line. I then made use of the nunchuck controller to be able to adjust the brightness of the laser just by twisting your wrist and holding down one of the buttons. This project has a lot of potential to take it to the next level and I listed a bunch of ideas that I had considered doing while writing the guide. You can check out the guide at https://learn.adafruit.com/nunchuck-controlled-laser-cat-toy.

The other big thing I did was I fixed a bug in the Web Serial ESPTool that had existed since my refactor and I hadn't been able to figure out. With several people running into the bug and Kattni finding a way to consistently reproduce the issue, I was able to narrow it down in the code and fix it.

**Scott**

This week I've continued working on the Raspberry Pi port of CircuitPython. I merged in full UART support and included a fix for the Raspberry Pi 4B disk image that prevented it from booting. Next, I started working on full SPI support. I've got it compiling and will test it today. After that, I'll add neopixel support.

I also had to tweak the CircuitPython CI to fix an unreliability that I introduced when I optimized the submodule fetch.

Codecademy, an online interactive learning platform used by more than 45 million people, has teamed up with the leading manufacturer in STEAM electronics, Adafruit Industries, to create a coding course, "Learn Hardware Programming with CircuitPython". The course is now available in the [Codecademy catalog](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-circuitpython?utm_source=adafruit&utm_medium=partners&utm_campaign=circuitplayground&utm_content=pythononhardwarenewsletter).

Python is a highly versatile, easy to learn programming language that a wide range of people, from visual effects artists in Hollywood to mission control at NASA, use to quickly solve problems. But you don’t need to be a rocket scientist to accomplish amazing things with it. This new course introduces programmers to Python by way of a microcontroller — CircuitPython — which is a Python-based programming language optimized for use on hardware.

CircuitPython’s hardware-ready design makes it easier than ever to program a variety of single-board computers, and this course gets you from no experience to working prototype faster than ever before. Codecademy’s interactive learning environment, combined with Adafruit's highly rated Circuit Playground Express, present aspiring hardware hackers with a never-before-seen opportunity to learn hardware programming seamlessly online.

Whether for those who are new to programming, or for those who want to expand their skill set to include physical computing, this course will have students getting familiar with Python and creating incredible projects along the way. By the end, students will have built their own bike lights, drum machine, and even a moisture detector that can tell when it's time to water a plant.
