## New Boards Supported by CircuitPython

The number of supported microcontrollers and Single Board Computers (SBC) grows every week. This section outlines which boards have been included in CircuitPython or added to [CircuitPython.org](https://circuitpython.org/).

This week, there were (#/no) new boards added!

- [Board name](url)
- [Board name](url)
- [Board name](url)

*Note: For non-Adafruit boards, please use the support forums of the board manufacturer for assistance, as Adafruit does not have the hardware to assist in troubleshooting.*

Looking to add a new board to CircuitPython? It's highly encouraged! Adafruit has four guides to help you do so:

- [How to Add a New Board to CircuitPython](https://learn.adafruit.com/how-to-add-a-new-board-to-circuitpython/overview)

## CircuitPython Libraries!

[![CircuitPython Libraries](../assets/20220315/blinka.png)](https://circuitpython.org/libraries)

CircuitPython support for hardware continues to grow. We are adding support for new sensors and breakouts all the time, as well as improving on the drivers we already have. As we add more libraries and update current ones, you can keep up with all the changes right here!

For the latest libraries, download the [Adafruit CircuitPython Library Bundle](https://circuitpython.org/libraries). For the latest community contributed libraries, download the [CircuitPython Community Bundle](https://github.com/adafruit/CircuitPython_Community_Bundle/releases).

If you'd like to contribute, CircuitPython libraries are a great place to start. Have an idea for a new driver? File an issue on [CircuitPython](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/issues)! Have you written a library you'd like to make available? Submit it to the [CircuitPython Community Bundle](https://github.com/adafruit/CircuitPython_Community_Bundle). Interested in helping with current libraries? Check out the [CircuitPython.org Contributing page](https://circuitpython.org/contributing). We've included open pull requests and issues from the libraries, and details about repo-level issues that need to be addressed. We have a guide on [contributing to CircuitPython with Git and Github](https://learn.adafruit.com/contribute-to-circuitpython-with-git-and-github) if you need help getting started. You can also find us in the #circuitpython channels on the [Adafruit Discord](https://adafru.it/discord).

You can check out this [list of all the Adafruit CircuitPython libraries and drivers available](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_Bundle/blob/master/circuitpython_library_list.md). 

The current number of CircuitPython libraries is **347**!

**New Libraries!**

## What’s the team up to this week?

What is the team up to this week? Let’s check in!

**Dan**

After several days of debugging, I was able to fix a bug that prevent auto-reload from working on CircuitPython on the SAMD21.

I expect to release CircuitPython 7.2.1 this week. It will include the bug fix above and several others. Then we will move on to 7.3.0-beta.0.

**Jeff**

[![Jeff](../assets/20220315/20220315jeff.jpg)](https://circuitpython.org/)

I've been working the bugs out of reading and writing Apple floppies using fluxengine host software & Adafruit_Floppy. I've also wired up & written software so that fluxengine can use an Apple "Disk ]\[" via Adafruit_Floppy. In this photo, you can see the optical sensor installed inside the Disk ]\[ to sense the rotation of the floppy drive. This fully reversible modification will be documented in an upcoming guide.

**Kattni**

This week I finally finished the TFT Feather ESP32-S2 guide. I ran into quite a few issues with code, the Learn System itself, and the physical board. It was a bugtastic week! I'm a huge fan of finding bugs, but that was getting old by the end. In the process, I also wrote a number of new templates which were included in the TFT Feather guide, and added to the non-TFT Feather ESP32-S3 guide.

After all of that, I was finally able to get started on the Feather ESP32 V2 guide. This board has no CircuitPython support, so the guide is significantly different than the ones I'm used to writing. And since it's a new board, with new features, I've had to update some of the Arduino templates and code to work properly. I've run into some issues with this guide as well, but it's still going much faster than the last one. Keep an eye out for that to be published soon!

**Melissa**

This past week I gave my talk, which was more of a demo for the Dublin Linux Developers group. I had a chance to work on Blinka a bit before that and added pre-commit support so that it will be much easier for people to submit pull requests. After that, I worked on the WebSerial ESPTool some more. I went and cleaned it up a bit and added ESP32-C3 support.

**Tim**

I had a few days of vacation this week and spent a bit less time with CircuitPython. I did some quick testing of a core auto-reload issue before leaving. I am back to full capacity now and will be working on some documentation around our recent efforts to add typing information to the CircuitPython repos. We also discovered that older libraries are having the wrong version number embedded within them when installed via pip. There was already a fix in the cookiecutter repo, I'll be looking into a way to update the existing repos with the fix.

**Scott**

This week I've continued working on USB Host support on the iMX RT (used in Teensy 4.x) I've sent out a draft PR but discovered when testing Teensy 4.1 that the non-debug build doesn't actually work. The debug prints must slow down the code to avoid a timing issue. The next step I took was to create a TinyUSB example that shows the problem outside of CircuitPython. I'll hand this off to Thach who has been helping me by making the needed changes to TinyUSB. We'll keep tag teaming USB host until it is in CircuitPython.

While I'm waiting for Thach, I'll be picking up the ESP32-S3 and fixing a few issues that have come up with it. In particular, there are a couple deep sleep issues that I'm going to take a look at. So, I'll be switching between USB Host and refining the ESP32-S3.
