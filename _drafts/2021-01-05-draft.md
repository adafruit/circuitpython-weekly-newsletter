## Coming Soon
There are so many new pieces of hardware under development, we're featuring them here. As with all things in the [Top Secret](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLjF7R1fz_OOWnS6phH64KwEJBekaawPBC) category, these things are being conceptualized - release dates are not available. Keep an eye out on [Adafruit New Products](https://www.adafruit.com/new) to watch for their possible introduction.

> We saw this nifty chip on the [nicechips sub-reddit](https://reddit.com/r/nicechips/comments/gzbsqn/aw9523_16_channel_i2c_io_expander_and_led_driver/) a few months ago and got a few samples. Recently we were thinking how we could really use this chip in a more complex design that could use a GPIO expander. So...it's time to make a STEMMA breakout! This I2C expander driver has 16 constant-current LED drivers and I/O pins. It seems pretty straightforward, just watch out for the address line 'default pin values' and the reset pin's internal pulldown. This breakout is looooooong so that you get every IO pin plus a matching ground pad.

## CircuitPython Libraries!

[![CircuitPython Libraries](../assets/20210105/blinka.png)](https://circuitpython.org/libraries)

CircuitPython support for hardware continues to grow. We are adding support for new sensors and breakouts all the time, as well as improving on the drivers we already have. As we add more libraries and update current ones, you can keep up with all the changes right here!

For the latest libraries, download the [Adafruit CircuitPython Library Bundle](https://circuitpython.org/libraries). For the latest community contributed libraries, download the [CircuitPython Community Bundle](https://github.com/adafruit/CircuitPython_Community_Bundle/releases).

If you'd like to contribute, CircuitPython libraries are a great place to start. Have an idea for a new driver? File an issue on [CircuitPython](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/issues)! Have you written a library you'd like to make available? Submit it to the [CircuitPython Community Bundle](https://github.com/adafruit/CircuitPython_Community_Bundle). Interested in helping with current libraries? Check out the [CircuitPython.org Contributing page](https://circuitpython.org/contributing). We've included open pull requests and issues from the libraries, and details about repo-level issues that need to be addressed. We have a guide on [contributing to CircuitPython with Git and Github](https://learn.adafruit.com/contribute-to-circuitpython-with-git-and-github) if you need help getting started. You can also find us in the #circuitpython channel on the [Adafruit Discord](https://adafru.it/discord).

I prepared and released CircuitPython 6.0.1. It fixed a significant BLE and FrequencyIO regressions. We also included Scott's JSON speedup, which is substantial.

Since then I've been working on fixes clearing the issue queue for 6.1.0. There are still a number of issues that need fixing or research.

This week was a short week for me. I worked with Bryan on the [new guide](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-ltr390-uv-sensor for the [Adafruit LTR390](https://www.adafruit.com/product/4831), and created the fritzing object for the board. I wrote the [guide](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-mpr121-gator) for the new [MPR121 QT Gator breakout](https://www.adafruit.com/product/4830). I also did some miscellaneous support on Discord and the forums.

This past week I took some time off and have been enjoying the holidays.

**Scott**

The big thing this week was getting the PinAlarm code merged in. PinAlarm allows you to wake from sleep (light or deep) based on the logic level of an external pin. This is commonly used to wake based on button presses or based on the interrupt line from an external sensor. Keep trying the latest versions of CircuitPython for the latest and greatest.

## Codecademy "Learn Hardware Programming with CircuitPython"

[![Codecademy CircuitPython](../assets/20210105/codecademy_python.png)](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-circuitpython?utm_source=adafruit&utm_medium=partners&utm_campaign=circuitplayground&utm_content=pythononhardwarenewsletter)

Codecademy, an online interactive learning platform used by more than 45 million people, has teamed up with the leading manufacturer in STEAM electronics, Adafruit Industries, to create a coding course, "Learn Hardware Programming with CircuitPython". The course is now available in the [Codecademy catalog](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-circuitpython?utm_source=adafruit&utm_medium=partners&utm_campaign=circuitplayground&utm_content=pythononhardwarenewsletter).

Python is a highly versatile, easy to learn programming language that a wide range of people, from visual effects artists in Hollywood to mission control at NASA, use to quickly solve problems. But you don’t need to be a rocket scientist to accomplish amazing things with it. This new course introduces programmers to Python by way of a microcontroller — CircuitPython — which is a Python-based programming language optimized for use on hardware.

CircuitPython’s hardware-ready design makes it easier than ever to program a variety of single-board computers, and this course gets you from no experience to working prototype faster than ever before. Codecademy’s interactive learning environment, combined with Adafruit's highly rated Circuit Playground Express, present aspiring hardware hackers with a never-before-seen opportunity to learn hardware programming seamlessly online.

Whether for those who are new to programming, or for those who want to expand their skill set to include physical computing, this course will have students getting familiar with Python and creating incredible projects along the way. By the end, students will have built their own bike lights, drum machine, and even a moisture detector that can tell when it's time to water a plant.

Visit Codecademy to access the [Learn Hardware Programming with CircuitPython](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-circuitpython?utm_source=adafruit&utm_medium=partners&utm_campaign=circuitplayground&utm_content=pythononhardwarenewsletter) course and Adafruit to purchase a [Circuit Playground Express](https://www.adafruit.com/product/3333).

Codecademy has helped more than 45 million people around the world upgrade their careers with technology skills. The company’s online interactive learning platform is widely recognized for providing an accessible, flexible, and engaging experience for beginners and experienced programmers alike. Codecademy has raised a total of $43 million from investors including Union Square Ventures, Kleiner Perkins, Index Ventures, Thrive Capital, Naspers, Yuri Milner and Richard Branson, most recently raising its $30 million Series C in July 2016.
