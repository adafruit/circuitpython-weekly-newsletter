## PyCon US 2022 This Week

[![PyCon US 2022](../assets/20220426/pyconus2022.png)](https://us.pycon.org/2022/l)

PyCon US 2022 is this week. The event is in-person with an online component from April 27, 2022 – May 5, 2022 in Salt Lake City, Utah USA. Head over to the [PyCon US 2022 website](https://us.pycon.org/2022/) for details about the conference and the schedule – [PyCon Blog](https://pycon.blogspot.com/2022/10/pycon-us-2022-website-and-sponsorship.html).

Kattni, Melissa and Jeff from Adafruit will be attending April 28th through May 3rd. Kattni and Melissa will be attending the Education Summit on April 28th. Kattni will be giving a talk at the Summit called Simplicity and Fun: Learning with CircuitPython. The team will also be hosting a Welcome to CircuitPython mini-sprint.

They will be hosting Open Spaces every day (time TBD), which will be an introduction to CircuitPython using the Circuit Playground Bluefruit (CPB). The Bluefruit boards will be provided, along with a few other accessories, to enable folks to explore CircuitPython. A quick-start will be available, as well as a series of other examples to delve into. All three team members will be available to help.

Kattni and Melissa will be hosting development Sprints May 2nd and 3rd - [Adafruit Blog](https://blog.adafruit.com/2022/04/18/looking-forward-to-pycon-2022-python-pyconus-pycon/) and the [Open Spaces GitHub](https://github.com/kattni/PyCon2022).

## Try out the micro:bit Python Editor (Beta)

[![micro:bit Python Editor (Beta)](../assets/20220426/20220426bit.jpg)](https://mailchi.mp/microbit.org/python-editor-beta)

The Micro:bit Educational Foundation is excited to announce that our new Python Editor has entered its Beta phase, meaning that we’re getting ready to to release it to the community - [microbit.org mailing](https://mailchi.mp/microbit.org/python-editor-beta) and [micro:bit support](https://support.microbit.org/support/solutions/articles/19000135210-python-editor-guide).

> The new editor has been built from the ground-up with classroom use in mind. It aims to make text-based coding more accessible to students who may find it hard to engage with the subject by removing known barriers to learning. It's also designed to make computer science appeal to more diverse cohorts and hence expand their horizons.

## Tom's Hardware Pimoroni Servo 2040 Review

[![Pimoroni Servo 2040 Review](../assets/20220426/20220426servo.jpg)](https://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/pimoroni-servo-2040-review-control-up-to-18-servos-with-rp2040)

Tom's Hardware reviews the new Pimoroni Servo 2040 board - [Tom's Hardware](https://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/pimoroni-servo-2040-review-control-up-to-18-servos-with-rp2040).

> We tested the Pimoroni Servo 2040 using MicroPython and CircuitPython. Pimoroni has created a new version of its MicroPython release which provides support for Servo 2040, and it seems that roboticist and developer Chris Parrott has poured a lot of love into the software that supports this project. The MicroPython modules for Servo 2040 are well documented and robust. We are seeing great hardware and software backed by great documentation.<br>&nbsp;<br>For our MicroPython test, we elected to use the Pimoroni’s version which also supports CircuitPython libraries. We wanted to test a few Stemma QT devices with MicroPython and this seemed like a great fit. We ran through Pimoroni’s examples, testing single and multiple servos. Everything went extremely smoothly.

## CircuitPython Online IDE for Classes

[![CircuitPython Online IDE for Classes](../assets/20220426/20220426ide.jpg)](https://github.com/urfdvw/CircuitPython-online-IDE-for-classes)

The CircuitPython Online IDE for Classes project provides nearly the same online IDE as the [CircuitPython Online IDE](https://github.com/urfdvw/CircuitPython-online-IDE). However, in this project, teaching functions are provided:

* Students sign in the IDE by a unique 'nicknames'
* Instructors can monitor the students' editor code and console outputs according to their 'nicknames'
* Instructors can monitor multiple students

With these additional functions, instructors can provide timely feedback to the students - [GitHub](https://github.com/urfdvw/CircuitPython-online-IDE-for-classes).

A paper on this was accepted to the ASEE (American Society for Engineering Education) 2022 conference! - [Twitter](https://twitter.com/River___Wang/status/1516518964142161922).

## The Memray Memory Profiler for Python Open Sourced

[![The Memray memory profiler for Python](../assets/20220426/20220426mem.jpg)](https://blog.adafruit.com/2022/04/21/the-memray-memory-profiler-for-python-open-sourced-opensource/)

Bloomberg has open sourced Memray, a memory profiler for Python. It can track Linux memory allocations in Python code, in native extension modules, and in the Python interpreter itself. 

It can generate several different types of reports to help analyze the captured memory usage data. While commonly used as a CLI tool, it can also be used as a library to perform more fine-grained profiling tasks - [Adafruit Blog](https://blog.adafruit.com/2022/04/21/the-memray-memory-profiler-for-python-open-sourced-opensource/) and [GitHub](https://github.com/bloomberg/memray).

## Project of the Week: A Multi MIDI Router

[![Multi MIDI Router](../assets/20220426/20220426midi.jpg)](https://diyelectromusic.wordpress.com/2022/04/22/raspberry-pi-pico-multi-midi-router-part-3/)

A multi-MIDI router (DIN and USB), using a Raspberry Pi Pico, Adafruit Trinket M0, and a Seeedstudio Xiao.

> One of the easiest ways right now to get USB MIDI device support on a Pico is to use CircuitPython, but I’ve not had much success so far with PIO in CircuitPython.  So I have the requirement that I want to use Micropython for PIO support, but need CircuitPython for USB MIDI device support.  Neither will support USB MIDI host functionality. This project is one enhancement that adds both by adding two “USB MIDI co-processors” to the Pico.

## What’s the team up to this week?

What is the team up to this week? Let’s check in!

**Dan**

I am continuing to work on an ESP32-S2 I2C issue, and am working with an Espressif engineer on a possible solution.

I'm tuning up the NeoPixel timings on various ports to be able to support all the different kinds of NeoPixels we sell.

I've been shepherding several pull requests from some new contributors to CircuitPython through the review process.

**Jeff**

I noticed ["Servo 2040", a new board from pimoroni](https://shop.pimoroni.com/products/servo-2040) appeared in [the Adafruit shop](https://www.adafruit.com/product/5437). This prompted the question of what it would take to support 18 servo motors at the same time in CircuitPython on the RP2040. It turns out that it should be possible with a small addition to the StateMachine class, and I have a [work in progress Pull Request](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/pull/6300). This may also unlock sending data to a PIO peripheral "in the background" from CircuitPython code, which is cool and will no doubt find uses.

In this image, 4 staggered "servo-like" signals are shown. The code adapts to any number of contiguous pins using just one StateMachine.

[![Signals](../assets/20220426/20220426jeff.jpg)](https://circuitpython.org/)

On Friday, Saturday and Sunday look for me at PyCon US 2022 in Salt Lake City. I'd be happy to talk with folks from the community, especially at the CircuitPython open spaces. I made myself a custom badge from a pygamer just for the occasion, so you can pick me out in a crowd.

[![PyGamer Badge](../assets/20220426/20220426jeff2.jpg)](https://circuitpython.org/)

**Kattni**

This week I published the Adafruit ESP32-S3 Feather guide. Much of it is tied to the ESP32-S2 Feather guide, as the boards are heavily similar. If you picked up one of the ESP32-S3 Feathers, and you're wondering where to start, check out this guide.

I am also working on testing PyLeap. PyLeap is an iOS app that allows you to connect to your Circuit Playground Bluefruit or CLUE board (in the unreleased beta version) from your iOS device, and download and transfer code from a number of Learn guides wirelessly to your board. I'll be working with our developer to get into a bug-fix cycle and get through what I found. Keep an eye out for the next PyLeap update!

**Melissa**

This past week I worked on a script that would install the MIPI driver for the raspberry pi including figuring out all the offsets and rotations to match the existing FrameBuffer-based drivers. I started working on trying to separate the touchscreen functionality from the old driver and while it does show up, I am still unable to receive touch events.

This next week I'll be at PyCon US - at the conference, open spaces, and at the sprints. If you are also attending, be sure to look for me there.

**Tim**

This week I tested a few network based PRs, to support multiple cookie headers, and try multiple ssid's if suplied in secrets.py for projects that utilize PortalBase. I addressed some feedback received on my core PR to allow TileGrids to have their bitmap changed after initialization as well as re-tested all of the behavior and argument validity checking. In preperation for that to be merged I started working on a SpriteButton class that will allow us to easily make fully custom bitmap buttons that can have separate sprites for pressed and un-pressed states. I did the final round of editing and on the typing information guide page and submitted it for moderation. It's been published and I'll be blogging it soon.

I'm starting to work on a Laser Harp project. I'll be using 8 time of flight sensors to "play" the harp. The harp will output MIDI and I'll be using a combination of detecting when my hands are over a ToF sensor and using the distance to affect CC values. I'm leaning towards including a Music Maker FeatherWing so that it can be a standalone synth.

This is going to be a larger project so I will also be working on documenting a quick USB to serial MIDI converter with a QT Py and CircuitPython. This was a project done by Sandy Macdonald on Twitter and we thought it would be great to document for the community.
