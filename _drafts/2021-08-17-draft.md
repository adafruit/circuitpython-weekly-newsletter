## Codespace for GitHub Arrives

[![Codespace](../assets/20210817/20210817dev.jpg)](https://www.theregister.com/2021/08/12/github_codespaces/)

GitHub's Codespaces, cloud-based development environments that have been in preview since May 2020, are finally here. When you create a Codespace, a shallow clone of your repository is made on a Linux virtual machine that is both dedicated and private. Prices range from $0.18 to $2.88 per hour. GitHub released Codespaces yesterday for organisations using Team and Enterprise plans. Individuals can continue to use the Codespaces beta if they have succeeded in obtaining access. GitHub said: "We'll share updates on what's coming in the near future."

GitHub has another neat feature called **github.dev**, which will remain **free**. When in a code repository, press the full stop character (period key) and an editor opens using a lightweight Codespace. What this means is that any file can be edited in the browser using a cut-down browser version of Visual Studio Code – which is very like the desktop version. There is no run or debug option in this lightweight environment, and clicking to debug prompts a dialog offering to continue either by cloning the repository locally or by starting a full Codespace - [The Register](https://www.theregister.com/2021/08/12/github_codespaces/).

Why Your Dev Board Won’t Catch On: A Retrospective of Arduino’s Popularity - [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/why-your-dev-board-wont-catch-retrospective-arduinos-popularity/).

> Languages like MicroPython and CircuitPython excite me, as they offer easy ramps to using microcontrollers, especially for those coming from the software world where Python is a popular language. They don’t necessarily solve the issue of cheap dev boards, but the communities do seem to be growing. Focusing on ease-of-use (despite any losses in efficiencies) is a key takeaway from the above factors. As an engineer, if I can’t understand your API and get an LED blinking in a couple of hours, I’m likely going to look elsewhere (unless, for some reason, I’m forced to use your platform).

## CircuitPython Project Bundle

[![BundleFly](../assets/20210817/20210817bundlefly.jpg)](https://learn.adafruit.com/)

When you get to the CircuitPython code section of an [Adafruit Learn Guide](https://learn.adafruit.com/), sometimes things can get a bit complicated. You not only have the code you need to upload to your device, but you likely also need to add some libraries that the code requires to run. This involved downloading all the libraries, digging through to find the ones you need, and copying them to your device. That was only the beginning on some projects, as those that include images and/or sound files required further downloading and copying of files. But, not anymore!

Now, with Project Bundles, you can download all the necessary code, libraries and, if needed, asset files with one click! We automatically check which libraries are required for the project and bundle them up for you. No more digging through a huge list of libraries to find the ones you need, or fiddling with looking for other files or dependencies. Download the Project Bundle, copy the contents to your device, and your code will simply work. We wanted to make this the easiest way to get a project working, regardless of whether you're a beginner or an expert. We'll also be adding this feature to popular IDEs as an add-on. Try it out with any Circuit Python guide on the Adafruit Learning System. Just look for the ‘Download Project Bundle’ button on the code page. 

**To download and use a Project Bundle:**

In the Learning System - above any embedded code in a guide in the Adafruit Learn System, you’ll find a Download Project Bundle button.

[![Project Bundle download button](../assets/20210817/20210817pblink.jpg)](https://learn.adafruit.com/)

Click the button to download the Project Bundle zip.

[![Project Bundle zip downloaded](../assets/20210817/20210817pbzipfile.jpg)](https://learn.adafruit.com/)

Open the Project Bundle zip to find the example code, all necessary libraries, and, if available, any images, sounds, etc.

[![Project Bundle unzipped](../assets/20210817/20210817pbdownload.jpg)](https://learn.adafruit.com/)

Simply copy all the files over to your CIRCUITPY drive, and you’re ready to go!

If you run into any problems or bugs, or would like to submit feedback, please file an issue on the [Adafruit Learning System Guides GitHub repo](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_Learning_System_Guides/issues).

## What’s the team up to this week?

What is the team up to this week? Let’s see!

[![Dan](../assets/20210817/20210817dan.jpg)](https://circuitpython.org/)

I was able to fix the "crackling" audio playback we were seeing on RP2040. Audio playback is done with two buffers which are used in alternation: while one buffer is being played using DMA, the other is being filled.

I instrumented the "DMA complete" interrupts and the buffer filling by toggling pins, and then observing the traces with a Saleae logic analyzer. I was able to determine that the wrong buffer was being filled when crackling audio was present. The flip-flopping between buffers was out of phase, probably due to an intermittent timing problem. I rewrote the code to determine which buffer actually needed filling by looking at the interrupt information in detail, instead of simply alternating between the buffers.

This same issue may be present on the SAMD51 implementation, which has similar code, and I'll take a look at that.

On Wednesday, August 11, I released CircuitPython 7.0.0-alpha.6, three weeks after the previous alpha. We are making good progress towards 7.0.0 final but still have a number of issues to fix. I need to finish some API changes to the custom HID device code, and then we can start issuing beta releases.

**Jeff**

The `qrio` module I mentioned last week is in the recent alpha release of CircuitPython, and I've been working on a guide that introduces how to use it. Next up, I'll be doing a week of bug-squashing to bring us closer to a stable release of CircutPython 7.

This week I updated the PCF8523 and DS3231 guides to include the STEMMA QT updates to the breakouts. Typically we replace header-only versions with the STEMMA QT versions, but in this case, the originals are still so popular, we added these as new products. So, instead of the guides being updated to be primarily STEMMA QT, they include both versions equally.

I also completed a lot of miscellaneous tasks that came up including PR testing and merging and working through an obtuse CI failure on a different PR. 

I'm still working on a MacroPad example that types out common phrases that I use on GitHub for me, but I still haven't settled on what phrases I want to use. The project includes Fidget Mode, which makes it so the MacroPad stops sending HID so I can fidget with the light up keys without sending errant strings to my computer. I updated Fidget Mode to be on by default, requiring a manual disable by pressing the rotary encoder switch, and enabling automatically after a customisable delay. That way I don't have to remember to enable it!

This past week was shorter because I was out sick for part of it. I did however finish up my guide on [MacroPad Remote Procedure Calls over USB to Control Home Assistant](https://learn.adafruit.com/macropad-remote-procedure-calls-over-usb-to-control-home-assistant). This goes over using Remote Procedure Calls to have the MacroPad communicate with the desktop and remotely run functions to allow the MacroPad to control things on your network.

This week I've continued fixing bugs in CircuitPython for 7.0.0. The two bugs I've been working on are tweaking time tracking on the SAMD21 which caused autoreload to break while doing PulseIn and fixing timer reset on the SAMD21 when pwmio isn't enabled. I'm going to tackle a few more bugs and then switch to expanding the BLE file transfer protocol a little to work better with the iOS files app.
