Welcome to the latest Python on Microcontrollers newsletter! It's clear that the use of Python on hardware projects is accelerating. Just take a look at this week's highlights. Python on LEGO automation controllers, micro:bit, and so many microcontroller boards and single board computers (SBC)! Have fun exploring this week's issue.

We're on [Discord](https://discord.gg/HYqvREz), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/search?q=circuitpython&src=typed_query&f=live), and for past newsletters - [view them all here](https://www.adafruitdaily.com/category/circuitpython/). If you're reading this on the web, [subscribe here](https://www.adafruitdaily.com/). Here's the news this week:

## Check Out the Simulator in the beta micro:bit Python Editor

[![Simulator](../assets/20220830/20220830sim.jpg)](https://mailchi.mp/microbit.org/please-test-the-simulator-in-our-new-python-editor)

A simulator is now available within the beta micro:bit Python Editor. This allows you to try your code before sending it to a micro:bit. The developers are fine tuning it over the next few weeks, so send thems your feedback to help make it even better - [micro:bit newsletter](https://mailchi.mp/microbit.org/please-test-the-simulator-in-our-new-python-editor).

## The MicroPython Forum Migration to GitHub Discussions

[![MicroPython Forum Migration](../assets/20220830/20220830mp.png)](https://forum.micropython.org/viewtopic.php?f=8&t=12971&sid=329429aeedb4a492901c29391b2c14e6)

After close to 9 years, the MicroPython team has decided to close their [forum](https://forum.micropython.org/) in favor of moving to GitHub Discussions - [MicroPython Forum Post](https://forum.micropython.org/viewtopic.php?f=8&t=12971&sid=329429aeedb4a492901c29391b2c14e6) and [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/orgs/micropython/discussions).

There's a few key features they really like about GitHub Discussions:

- Much tighter integration with the rest of the development process which is all hosted on GitHub. We can move Discussions to/from Issues, etc, as well as @ members and reference PRs/Issues.
- GitHub Discussions has many more features for posts and replies. Emoji responses, accepted answers, threaded replies, etc.
- GitHub Discussions uses the much more familiar Markdown syntax for writing posts, especially for code snippets (which also support syntax highlighting).
- It's less maintenance for the MicroPython team (--> more time to work on features and fixes!).
- Easier account signup (and for many people who already use GitHub, no new account required at all).

## PyBricks - Python for LEGO

[![PyBricks](../assets/20220830/20220830pybricks.jpg)](https://pybricks.com/)

Pybricks is Python coding for smart LEGO® hubs. Run MicroPython scripts directly on the hub, and get full control of your motors and sensors.

## New Boards Supported by CircuitPython

The number of supported microcontrollers and Single Board Computers (SBC) grows every week. This section outlines which boards have been included in CircuitPython or added to [CircuitPython.org](https://circuitpython.org/).

This week, there were (#/no) new boards added!

- [Board name](url)
- [Board name](url)
- [Board name](url)

*Note: For non-Adafruit boards, please use the support forums of the board manufacturer for assistance, as Adafruit does not have the hardware to assist in troubleshooting.*

Looking to add a new board to CircuitPython? It's highly encouraged! Adafruit has four guides to help you do so:

- [How to Add a New Board to CircuitPython](https://learn.adafruit.com/how-to-add-a-new-board-to-circuitpython/overview)

## CircuitPython Libraries!

[![CircuitPython Libraries](../assets/20220830/blinka.png)](https://circuitpython.org/libraries)

CircuitPython support for hardware continues to grow. We are adding support for new sensors and breakouts all the time, as well as improving on the drivers we already have. As we add more libraries and update current ones, you can keep up with all the changes right here!

For the latest libraries, download the [Adafruit CircuitPython Library Bundle](https://circuitpython.org/libraries). For the latest community contributed libraries, download the [CircuitPython Community Bundle](https://github.com/adafruit/CircuitPython_Community_Bundle/releases).

If you'd like to contribute, CircuitPython libraries are a great place to start. Have an idea for a new driver? File an issue on [CircuitPython](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/issues)! Have you written a library you'd like to make available? Submit it to the [CircuitPython Community Bundle](https://github.com/adafruit/CircuitPython_Community_Bundle). Interested in helping with current libraries? Check out the [CircuitPython.org Contributing page](https://circuitpython.org/contributing). We've included open pull requests and issues from the libraries, and details about repo-level issues that need to be addressed. We have a guide on [contributing to CircuitPython with Git and GitHub](https://learn.adafruit.com/contribute-to-circuitpython-with-git-and-github) if you need help getting started. You can also find us in the #circuitpython channels on the [Adafruit Discord](https://adafru.it/discord).

You can check out this [list of all the Adafruit CircuitPython libraries and drivers available](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_Bundle/blob/master/circuitpython_library_list.md). 

The current number of CircuitPython libraries is **364**!

**New Libraries!**

* Too many to list this week!

## What’s the team up to this week?

What is the team up to this week? Let’s check in!

**Dan**

I had a great team being on two different live stream panels for CircuitPython Day. Thanks to all who organized and volunteered for the day.

I am continuing to fix bugs for the 8.0.0 release. I've backported some of the more important fixes to the 7.3.x branch, and plan to release 7.3.3 by the time this newsletter comes out.

**Kattni**

This past week, I finished up the [ESP32-S3 TFT Feather guide](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-esp32-s3-tft-feather). It's one of the beefiest board guides yet, as it has all of the compatible CircuitPython Essentials pages added, which we, thus far, have not been consistent about. The guide has been live for a bit, but it wasn't entirely finished until this week.

I also started working with the Feather ESP32 V2 and CircuitPython, and the CircuitPython web workflow. The plan is to redo my LoRa mailbox project with WiFi and AdafruitIO. The reason for using the ESP32 is that we still need more thorough testing, and I'm really good at finding bugs. Found a big one within 10ish minutes of picking it up, which is basically how it goes. This will be in an upcoming guide. I hope to also include the original LoRa version.

**Melissa**

This past week, I did my first livestream. If you missed it, you can still [watch it on YouTube](https://youtu.be/60o6jdvV6ig). I also added around 15 new boards over on [circuitpython.org](https://circuitpython.org). On the Code Editor, I ended up replacing the hterm component, that we use to show the serial terminal, with xterm and web workflow on the code editor now works in Firefox.

**Tim**

For CircuitPython Day, I participated in a panel discussion livestream and in the evening held a special Game Jam live stream where I made a CircuitPython version of a space ship asteroid mining game, inspired by old arcade games Galaga, Space Invaders and similar games. I learned out to make debug builds of CircuitPython and how to parse the stack trace outputs that they generate for hard fault errors. I also learned more about how to use GitHub Actions, enough to figure out how to set up one actions step that outputs some information and a seperate actions step that runs conditionally based on the output of the first. This is utilized in a proposed PR to cookie cutter that will make the actions-bot leave comments on library PRs under certain conditions based around the size of the compiled mpy file.

**Liz**

On CircuitPython Day, I hosted the [special edition Show and Tell livestream](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXK5W3QuyvY). It was a great turnout with a wide variety of projects. Big thanks to Kattni for all of the organization she did to bring the day together.

For guides, this past week I published the final of three Azure CircuitPython guides. This project uses a [Raspberry Pi with Azure IoT Hub](https://learn.adafruit.com/raspberry-pi-iot-dashboard-with-azure-and-circuitpython) to create a dashboard to view your devices' data and subscription information. The Python code on the Raspberry Pi uses the Azure SDK combined with the Blinka DisplayIO PyGame library, which allows for DisplayIO elements to be shown over HDMI. I hope folks will find it to be a good example for not only Azure IoT Hub but also combining Python SDKs with Blinka CircuitPython libraries.
