## New Boards Supported by CircuitPython

The number of supported microcontrollers and Single Board Computers (SBC) grows every week. This section outlines which boards have been included in CircuitPython or added to [CircuitPython.org](https://circuitpython.org/).

This week, there were (#/no) new boards added:

- [Board name](url)
- [Board name](url)
- [Board name](url)

*Note: For non-Adafruit boards, please use the support forums of the board manufacturer for assistance, as Adafruit does not have the hardware to assist in troubleshooting.*

Looking to add a new board to CircuitPython? It's highly encouraged! Adafruit has four guides to help you do so:

- [How to Add a New Board to CircuitPython](https://learn.adafruit.com/how-to-add-a-new-board-to-circuitpython/overview)
- [How to add a New Board to the circuitpython.org website](https://learn.adafruit.com/how-to-add-a-new-board-to-the-circuitpython-org-website)

## CircuitPython Libraries

[![CircuitPython Libraries](../assets/20231120/blinka.png)](https://circuitpython.org/libraries)

The CircuitPython library numbers are continually increasing, while existing ones continue to be updated. Here we provide library numbers and updates!

To get the latest Adafruit libraries, download the [Adafruit CircuitPython Library Bundle](https://circuitpython.org/libraries). To get the latest community contributed libraries, download the [CircuitPython Community Bundle](https://circuitpython.org/libraries).

If you'd like to contribute to the CircuitPython project on the Python side of things, the libraries are a great place to start. Check out the [CircuitPython.org Contributing page](https://circuitpython.org/contributing). If you're interested in reviewing, check out Open Pull Requests. If you'd like to contribute code or documentation, check out Open Issues. We have a guide on [contributing to CircuitPython with Git and GitHub](https://learn.adafruit.com/contribute-to-circuitpython-with-git-and-github), and you can find us in the #help-with-circuitpython and #circuitpython-dev channels on the [Adafruit Discord](https://adafru.it/discord).

You can check out this [list of all the Adafruit CircuitPython libraries and drivers available](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_Bundle/blob/master/circuitpython_library_list.md).

## What’s the CircuitPython team up to this week?

What is the team up to this week? Let’s check in:

**Dan**

I released CircuitPython 9.0.0-alpha.5 and 8.2.8 last week. [PROBABLY - CHECK DURING EDIT] The alpha release fixes some significant issues that prevented running larger programs. The 8.2.8 has small fixes, and also handles wider variety of flash chips on various boards, so we can substitute equivalent chips during manufacturing.

I'm continuing to fix more 8.2.x and 9.0.0 bugs as we move toward a 9.0.0 release.

**Melissa**

This past week, I helped Erin St. Blaine out with an upcoming Learn Guide project, which is based on my [Animated Message Board Guide](https://learn.adafruit.com/matrixportal-circuitpython-animated-message-board). In the process, we found a few bugs that I fixed in the Message Board code and update the GitHub Repository.

**Tim**

I updated instances of `displayio` API usage to support the changes in 9.x within learn guide pages. I finished up the code in the Learn repository last week, and then the non-embedded sections of guide pages this week. The other main thing I've been working on is web workflow support within circup so that it can be used to install libraries on devices that don't present as USB storage drives. 

**Jeff**

It's nice to be back from vacation. I've started digging into items on our issue tracker as I work with the rest of the team on stabilizing the development branch after all the changes that have recently been incorporated.

**Scott**

This week I've been mostly out to spend time with family. I did do two major fixes after the split heap changes that were in 9.0.0 alpha 4. One fixed "pystack exhausted" and one fixed memory allocation errors on ESP. Dan is releasing 9.0.0 alpha 5 shortly that should work much better.

**Liz**

This week I worked on the guide and CircuitPython library for the [ADS7830 breakout](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-ads7830-8-channel-8-bit-adc). It is an eight-channel, eight-bit ADC, which means you can use it to add 8 ADC inputs over I2C. I'm currently working on a project with JP that uses two of these breakouts to add 16 slide potentiometers to a project.
