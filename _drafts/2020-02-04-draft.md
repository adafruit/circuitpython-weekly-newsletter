## CircuitPython and Feather power wheelchair as an Xbox controller

[![Freedom Wing Adapter](../assets/02042020/2420freedom.gif)](https://youtu.be/FgKNWc-EpHQ)

Freedom Wing Adapter – Adapter allows power wheelchairs to control Xbox - [YouTube](https://youtu.be/FgKNWc-EpHQ):

>_"Introducing The Freedom Wing Adapter! In partnership with AT Makers, together we’ve created the first of its kind adapter to enable a player using a power wheelchair to control an Xbox. And we’re going to release it to the world for free. The AbleGamers Charity creates opportunities that enable play, in order to combat social isolation, foster inclusive communities, and improve the quality of life for people with disabilities."_

## Get a CLUE!

[![CLUE](../assets/02042020/2420clue01.jpg)](https://www.adafruit.com/clue)

[![CLUE](../assets/02042020/2420clue02.jpg)](https://www.adafruit.com/clue)

The micro:bit shaped, CircuitPython-powered, sensor-packed CLUE is shipping! We wanted to build some projects that have a small screen and a lot of sensors. To make it compatible with existing projects, we made it the same shape and size as the BBC micro:bit and with the same edge-connector on the bottom with 5 big pads so it will fit into your existing robot kit or 'bit add-on. This is the alpha release of the hardware. This is the alpha release of the hardware, everything works, but we may change around the sensors or pinouts as we add projects and support for the CLUE! 

While the CLUE looks a bit like a 'bit it has totally redesigned-from-scratch technology:

 * Nordic nRF52840 Bluetooth LE processor - 1 MB of Flash, 256KB RAM, 64 MHz Cortex M4 processor
 * 1.3″ 240×240 Color IPS TFT display for high resolution text and graphics
 * Power it from any 3-6V battery source (internal regulator and protection diodes)
 * Two A / B user buttons and one reset button
 * Tons of sensors!
 * ST Micro series 9-DoF motion - LSM6DS33 Accel/Gyro + LIS3MDL magnetometer
 * APDS9960 Proximity, Light, Color, and Gesture Sensor
 * PDM Microphone sound sensor
 * SHT30 Humidity
 * BMP280 temperature and barometric pressure/altitude
 * RGB NeoPixel indicator LED
 * 2 MB internal flash storage for datalogging, images, fonts or CircuitPython code
 * Buzzer/speaker for playing tones and beeps
 * Two bright white LEDs in front for illumination / color sensing.
 * Qwiic / STEMMA QT connector for adding more sensors, motor controllers, or displays over I2C. You can plug in GROVE I2C sensors by using an adapter cable.
 * Programmable with CircuitPython and Arduino

The CLUE is designed for projects that use a ton of sensors - and they're all built in! So you can start exploring your world, measuring, logging and learning. You can transmit data over Bluetooth to a computer or mobile device for data plotting and logging, or save it to the built in storage - [adafruit.com/clue](https://www.adafruit.com/clue) & [MAKE coverage](https://makezine.com/2020/01/31/adafruit-clue-a-microbit-form-factor-smorgasbord/).

## Call for help – CircuitPython messaging to other languages!

[![Hello world](../assets/02042020/2420helloworld.jpg)](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/issues/1098)

We [recently posted on the Adafruit blog](https://blog.adafruit.com/2018/08/15/help-bring-circuitpython-messaging-to-other-languages-circuitpython/) about bringing CircuitPython messaging to other languages, one of the exciting features of CircuitPython 4.x is translated control and error messages. Native language messages will help non-native English speakers understand what is happening in CircuitPython even though the Python keywords and APIs will still be in English. If you would like to help, [please post](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/issues/1098) to the main issue on GitHub and join us on [Discord](https://adafru.it/discord).

We made this graphic with translated text, we could use your help with that to make sure we got the text right, please check out the text in the image – if there is anything we did not get correct, please let us know. Dan sent me this [handy site too](http://helloworldcollection.de/#Human).
