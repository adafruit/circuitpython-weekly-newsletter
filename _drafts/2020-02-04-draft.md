[![Freedom Wing Adapter](../assets/02042020/2420freedom.gif)](https://youtu.be/FgKNWc-EpHQ)

Freedom Wing Adapter – Adapter allows power wheelchairs to control Xbox - [YouTube](https://youtu.be/FgKNWc-EpHQ):

>_"Introducing The Freedom Wing Adapter! In partnership with AT Makers, together we’ve created the first of its kind adapter to enable a player using a power wheelchair to control an Xbox. And we’re going to release it to the world for free. The AbleGamers Charity creates opportunities that enable play, in order to combat social isolation, foster inclusive communities, and improve the quality of life for people with disabilities."_

## Get a CLUE!

[![CLUE](../assets/02042020/2420clue01.jpg)](https://www.adafruit.com/clue)

[![CLUE](../assets/02042020/2420clue02.jpg)](https://www.adafruit.com/clue)

The micro:bit shaped, CircuitPython-powered, sensor-packed CLUE is shipping! We wanted to build some projects that have a small screen and a lot of sensors. To make it compatible with existing projects, we made it the same shape and size as the BBC micro:bit and with the same edge-connector on the bottom with 5 big pads so it will fit into your existing robot kit or 'bit add-on. This is the alpha release of the hardware. This is the alpha release of the hardware, everything works, but we may change around the sensors or pinouts as we add projects and support for the CLUE! 

While the CLUE looks a bit like a 'bit it has totally redesigned-from-scratch technology:

 * Nordic nRF52840 Bluetooth LE processor - 1 MB of Flash, 256KB RAM, 64 MHz Cortex M4 processor
 * 1.3″ 240×240 Color IPS TFT display for high resolution text and graphics
 * Power it from any 3-6V battery source (internal regulator and protection diodes)
 * Two A / B user buttons and one reset button
 * Tons of sensors!
 * ST Micro series 9-DoF motion - LSM6DS33 Accel/Gyro + LIS3MDL magnetometer
 * APDS9960 Proximity, Light, Color, and Gesture Sensor
 * PDM Microphone sound sensor
 * SHT Humidity
 * BMP280 temperature and barometric pressure/altitude
 * RGB NeoPixel indicator LED
 * 2 MB internal flash storage for datalogging, images, fonts or CircuitPython code
 * Buzzer/speaker for playing tones and beeps
 * Two bright white LEDs in front for illumination / color sensing.
 * Qwiic / STEMMA QT connector for adding more sensors, motor controllers, or displays over I2C. You can plug in GROVE I2C sensors by using an adapter cable.
 * Programmable with CircuitPython

The CLUE is designed for projects that use a ton of sensors - and they're all built in! So you can start exploring your world, measuring, logging and learning. You can transmit data over Bluetooth to a computer or mobile device for data plotting and logging, or save it to the built in storage - [adafruit.com/clue](https://www.adafruit.com/clue) & [MAKE coverage](https://makezine.com/2020/01/31/adafruit-clue-a-microbit-form-factor-smorgasbord/).

Codecademy, an online interactive learning platform used by more than 45 million people, has teamed up with the leading manufacturer in STEAM electronics, Adafruit Industries, to create a coding course, "Learn Hardware Programming with CircuitPython". The course is now available in the [Codecademy catalog](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-circuitpython?utm_source=adafruit&utm_medium=partners&utm_campaign=circuitplayground&utm_content=pythononhardwarenewsletter).

Python is a highly versatile, easy to learn programming language that a wide range of people, from visual effects artists in Hollywood to mission control at NASA, use to quickly solve problems. But you don’t need to be a rocket scientist to accomplish amazing things with it. This new course introduces programmers to Python by way of a microcontroller — CircuitPython — which is a Python-based programming language optimized for use on hardware.

CircuitPython’s hardware-ready design makes it easier than ever to program a variety of single-board computers, and this course gets you from no experience to working prototype faster than ever before. Codecademy’s interactive learning environment, combined with Adafruit's highly rated Circuit Playground Express, present aspiring hardware hackers with a never-before-seen opportunity to learn hardware programming seamlessly online.

Whether for those who are new to programming, or for those who want to expand their skill set to include physical computing, this course will have students getting familiar with Python and creating incredible projects along the way. By the end, students will have built their own bike lights, drum machine, and even a moisture detector that can tell when it's time to water a plant.
