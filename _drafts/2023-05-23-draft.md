Welcome to the latest Python on Microcontrollers newsletter! CircuitPython is so close to releasing version 8.1.0 with release candidate 0 out now. This will likely be the last 8.x update before a version 9.0. There are many great projects this week with MicroPython, including a physical motorized Minecraft box made with LEGO. Linux site LWN reviews MicroPython v1.20 and so much more. Enjoy. - *Ed.*

We're on [Discord](https://discord.gg/HYqvREz), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/search?q=circuitpython&src=typed_query&f=live), and for past newsletters - [view them all here](https://www.adafruitdaily.com/category/circuitpython/). If you're reading this on the web, [subscribe here](https://www.adafruitdaily.com/). Here's the news this week:

## CircuitPython 8.1.0 Release Candidate 0 Is Out

[![CircuitPython 8.1.0 Release Candidate 0 Released](../assets/20230523/20230523cp8.jpg)](https://blog.adafruit.com/2023/05/16/circuitpython-8-1-0-release-candidate-0-released/)

CircuitPython 8.1.0-rc.0, a release candidate for 8.1.0, is now available.

## Making a Minecraft Block Real Using LEGO and PyBricks (MicroPython)

[![Making a Minecraft Block Real](../assets/20230523/20230523pybrick.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQDgyRDVn5c)

Brick Machines on YouTube creates a 100% working LEGO® Shulker Box from Minecraft. It is fully functional and looks just like the one in the game. Not only can this shulker box store items, it has password protection too. It's got the same animation as Minecraft, and some extras. The best part of the video is the end...there is a big explosion you won't want to miss!

The build uses [PyBricks](https://pybricks.com/), which is MicroPython on LEGO programmable blocks - [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQDgyRDVn5c) via [Twitter](https://twitter.com/laurensvalk/status/1660240122497908736).

## Review of MicroPython v1.20

[![Review of MicroPython v1.20](../assets/20230523/20230523mp.png)](https://lwn.net/Articles/931051/)

LWN.net, a Linux site, provides a thorough review of the latest MicroPython release - v1.20. - [LWN.net](https://lwn.net/Articles/931051/).

> For those looking for an easy way to program microcontrollers, MicroPython has much to offer. Together with alternatives like [Adafruit's MicroPython fork CircuitPython](https://lwn.net/Articles/789930/) and the [education-focused Snek](https://lwn.net/Articles/810201/), it shows that Python has a place in the embedded world. The closest competitor for microcontroller development, [Arduino](https://www.arduino.cc/), requires at least some knowledge of C++, but Python is generally easier to pick up. Moreover, as the WebAssembly port and its use as a smaller and faster PyScript runtime shows, MicroPython seems to be well suited for other constrained environments as well.

## Project of the Week: Reviving the Assistive Technology Quinkey and Microwriter Keypads

[![Quinkey and Microwriter Keypads](../assets/20230523/20230523mw.jpg)](https://octodon.social/@vik@mastodon.nzoss.nz/110357839296190386)

Quirkey is CircuitPython code for the Pi Pico version of the Quirkey keyboard, based heavily on the work done by Microwriter. The device emulates a USB HID US keyboard and requires no specific driver. It does however need the Adafruit HID CircuitPython libraries which can be downloaded from Adafruit's HID example web page or from Github. It now includes a simple "typing tudor" application - [GitHub](https://github.com/VikOlliver/Quirkey) via [Mastodon](https://octodon.social/@vik@mastodon.nzoss.nz/110357839296190386).

> The [Microwriter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microwriter) and Quinkey were 6-key chord keyboards created in the 80's for use by people with various physical limitations such as brittle bones. They developed a following among all types of users being simple, reliable, easy to use, and effectively allowed instant touch typing at speed.

Adafruit recently sold out of their stock of [Bus Pirates](https://github.com/BusPirate/Bus_Pirate) and when they booked a reorder, they found it’s currently unavailable with no ETA for re-stocking. It made them think about revisiting this design, perhaps using an RP2040 instead: with native USB and CircuitPython and PIO it might be easier to add new protocols! Ladyada did a “Circuit Pyrate” draft many years ago but it was based on the SAMD21 and she quickly ran out of space – another thing the RP2040 would excel at - [Adafruit Blog](https://blog.adafruit.com/2023/05/08/yaaarrr-a-circuit-pyrate-is-ready-to-be-your-best-mate-on-the-hacking-seas/).

## What’s the CircuitPython team up to this week?

What is the team up to this week? Let’s check in!

**Dan**

I released CircuitPython 8.1.0-rc.0, the initial release candidate for CircuitPython 8.1.0 final, on Tuesday, May 16. If all goes well we will release 8.1.0 final sometime during the week of this newsletter.

I'm fixing a long-standing bug with TouchAlarm on Espressif. To find it, I did a "bisect" between a known good version and a "bad" version with the bug. Between the good and the bad version there are many changes. You can divide the consecutive list of changes in half, and test the version in the middle, between the two halves. That version will work or not. Now you have a new good or bad version. You divide the new list in half, and try again. Each time you eliminate half the changes. Eventually you get down to a single change, which should be the change that caused the bug. Bisecting lets you pinpoint where things went wrong. In my case, there were initially hundreds of changes, but it only took about eight steps to pinpoint the errant change.

**Kattni**

This week I've been working on the code and guide for my Canary Nightlight collab project with 3D printing wizard Noe. Have you always wanted a blue canary for the outlet by the light switch, especially one who watches over you? We have you covered. I made some final changes to the code that make it more customisable, readable, and clear. I'm really happy with out how turned out. That guide should go live next week!

**Melissa**

This past week, I worked on a number of things including some GitHub Pull Requests for [Adafruit_Python_PlatformDetect](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_Python_PlatformDetect/pulls) and [Raspberry-Pi-Installer-Scripts](https://github.com/adafruit/Raspberry-Pi-Installer-Scripts/pulls). Some of these were to address issues that had been waiting while I had wrapped up other projects.

I also spent some time trying to fix Pulse Audio error messages on the Raspberry Pi for a collaboration project that I am trying to wrap up. While I wasn't able to completely eliminate the errors altogether, I was able to reduce them. I was also fixing some issues with the SpeechRecognition library crashing with some weird errors that I was finally able to get past just by looking at the included code, which shows the value of including basic working examples with libraries.

**Tim**

This week in addition to library reviews I worked on a test for a fix to javascript capabilities of the docs for libraries. I also set up a device with a debugging build to try to capture logs from a hard fault. I worked on some changes in the project files screenshot utility to start showing a settings.toml file when appropriate in the screenshots as well.

**Jeff**

This week in synthesizers, I replaced the original API for vibrato & tremolo with a much more generic one based on low-frequency oscillators and arithmetic blocks. This also enabled pitch bend to be applied to the ring waveform of a note, in addition to applying to the primary waveform.

Creating networks of these blocks lets you create lively, always-varying sounds in effectively limitless ways.

This work, which is in an open pull request, does make incompatible changes to the synthio API.

I also implemented FIR filtering in the Synthesizer, making it possible to apply low/high/notch/band filters to the generated audio. This takes a lot of computation so it's best done on a Metro M7 or an overclocked RP2040. This may change, as I have received the suggestion to investigate IIR filtering as an alternative.

Just a reminder, as we're approaching the release of 8.1.0: everything about the synthio API is considered experimental, so it may change incompatibly as it develops, even if it's otherwise in a "stable" release.

**Scott**

This past week has largely been working on a debug probe (mostly SWD) library and porting the higher level flashing functions from [Adafruit_DAP](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_DAP) on top of it. This will make it possible to flash the UF2 bootloader to a SAMD21, SAMD51 or nRF52 from any CircuitPython board. This can revive boards that have had their bootloader corrupted for some reason. Right now it bitbangs the protocol which makes it slow *but* also means it'll work on any CircuitPython board that has enough RAM to run the code.

**Liz**

This week I published two new product guides. The first was for the [RP2040 CAN Bus Feather](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-rp2040-can-bus-feather). This Feather has an MCP25625 CAN controller onboard, which is an MCP2515 with a built-in transceiver. The second guide was for the [PiCowbell with DVI Output](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-picowbell-dvi-output). This board lets you add DVI output to your Pico or Pico W. For this guide I ported Phil B.'s excellent [16bit_hello Arduino code](https://github.com/adafruit/PicoDVI/blob/master/examples/16bit_hello/16bit_hello.ino) to CircuitPython. It was a fun exercise to port that code since I had to use garbage collection and pop() to clean-up the displayio group to keep enough memory in play for the examples to continuously loop.
