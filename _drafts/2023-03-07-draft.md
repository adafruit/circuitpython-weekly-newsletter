Welcome to the latest Python on Microcontrollers newsletter! The last week was very busy! CircuitPython 8.1.0beta0 dropped with the huge addition of native animated GIF playing support (up to 480x320) and more. Your editor and others were quick to kick the tires, find issues and optimizations. Raspberry Pi has new documentation for their RP2040 chip and boards out. There are some very novel projects out there as well as interesting hardware coming soon. I hope you enjoy this issue. And if you ever have news or projects to share, please post it on the 'net and send a link to cpnews(at)adafruit(dot)com for consideration - *Ed.*

## A CircuitPython Battery Tester Which Works From Big Car Batteries Down to Teeny-Tiny Coin Cells

[![CircuitPython Battery Tester](../assets/20230307/20230307bat.jpg)](https://www.hackster.io/news/this-circuitpython-battery-tester-works-from-big-car-batteries-down-to-teeny-tiny-coin-cells-86932ee5aaf5)

Powered by a Raspberry Pi Pico, this battery tester uses a solid-state relay to shunt current through the user's choice of resistors - [hackster.io](https://www.hackster.io/news/this-circuitpython-battery-tester-works-from-big-car-batteries-down-to-teeny-tiny-coin-cells-86932ee5aaf5) and [YouTube](https://youtu.be/ewh2iR2EQAQ).

The device is powered by a Raspberry Pi Pico development board running CircuitPython on a RP2040 microcontroller, connected to an Adafruit 16×2 character-based LCD with buttons for user input and status reporting. There's a Texas Instruments INA260 battery monitor, connected via I2C, and a solid-state relay plus three different resistors to provide an adjustable current sink.

## Making Animated GIF Display on a Floppy

[![Making Animated GIF Floppies](../assets/20230307/20230307max.gif)](https://twitter.com/adafruit/status/1631151938921279491)

Your editor has been kicking the tires on the new animated GIF support in CircuitPython 8.1.0beta0. Taking the [Floppy with a Display](https://learn.adafruit.com/a-floppy-thumb-drive-with-a-color-file-icon-display/overview) hardware, I loaded the beta and a test GIF player. It worked out of the gate! First was a Max Headroom demo, initially posted to Twitter. About 10 different iterations were made with memes, computer and software startup screens and more. Likely when 8.1.0 is released, there will be an Adafruit guide on using animated GIFs as we are still working out subtle bugs and performance. A huge shout out to CircuitPython community member Mark Komus for adding this capability, it was my top #CircuitPython2023 request - [Twitter initial post](https://twitter.com/anne_engineer/status/1630375626682105858), [Adafruit Blog video medley](https://twitter.com/adafruit/status/1631151938921279491), and [Adafruit Show and Tell](https://www.youtube.com/live/ur-Gl-fj6HA?feature=share&t=309).

## What’s the team up to this week?

What is the team up to this week? Let’s check in!

**Dan**

I released CircuitPython 8.1.0-beta.0 on Tuesday; it's our first beta for 8.1.0. The release includes support for **safemode.py**, which I documented in a new Learn Guide: [CircuitPython Safe Mode](https://learn.adafruit.com/circuitpython-safe-mode).

I'm continuing to look at new and old issues for the 8.x.x releases of CircuitPython.

**Melissa**

This past week, I wrote a library to merge binary files at different offsets for use in flashing with esptool. This allows for [the WipperSnapper Firmware Uploader](https://adafruit.github.io/WipperSnapper_Firmware_Uploader/) to be able to generate downloadable images for flashing later in case users have trouble using the built-in flashing tool.

The CircuitPython Installer I have been working for quite a while was merged in as well. This tool requires a Chrome browser. This is a tool for [ESP32-based boards on circuitpython.org](https://circuitpython.org/downloads?mcufamilies=esp32s3&mcufamilies=esp32s2&mcufamilies=esp32c3&mcufamilies=esp32) A few follow-up bug fixes were needed, but the tool is ready for testing. It allows for easily flashing CircuitPython and boot loaders using Web Serial and the File System Access APIs right from the circuitpython.org website. This is especially useful for ESP32 boards because there is no native USB and thus no CIRCUITPY drive. For boards without a CIRCUITPY drive, normally the WiFi settings need to be configured via the REPL, however the installer handles all of this for you.

I worked on some additional examples and fixes in two new 7 color eink libraries. I tested some proposed fixes for UART usage of the PN532 NFC card reader. Lastly I've begun updating example code for the displayio API changes that the now stable 8.0.0 brought.

I published a guide for the Floppy FeatherWing. It includes a CircuitPython example for reading raw flux from a floppy disk.

I have a guide in the works using CircuitPython to adapt the SNES "Mario Paint" mouse to a modern PC using CircuitPython. Watch the New Guides section to find out when that's released *(it's released - Ed.)*

This week has been a whirlwind. The Bangle.js 2 and pulseio.PWMOut fix PRs were merged in. I've kept working on analyzing performance of CircuitPython on the iMX RT. I got SWO working for debug messages and have been experimenting with generating full function traces. I've learned that `_veneer` functions are used to call code on flash from tightly couple memory (TCM) or vice versa.

There have been some seemingly random crashes that I'm digging into. The iMX reads code directly from flash and sometimes we're writing to the same flash. Any mistakes in the code around this sharing could lead to mysterious crashes. In theory, function tracing should help but it isn't stable on its own yet. So, I've been digging deep into CP on the iMX and not doing much concrete. However, the things I'm learning should help us get CP rock solid on the iMX (and make it easier to debug new issues).

This week I worked on some product guides. I updated the [I2C/SPI LCD Backpack guide](https://learn.adafruit.com/i2c-spi-lcd-backpack) for the new STEMMA QT version. I also updated the [ATtiny Breakouts guide](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-attiny817-seesaw) for the new ATtiny816 and ATtiny1616 versions in the shop. I added a page on how to reprogram the boards with a UPDI programmer, which I think will be helpful for folks.

I have also been making slow but steady progress on the robot lyre project. The CAD design has proven to be very challenging, but I think I've finally gotten it. [I posted up a demo](https://mastodon.social/@blitzcitydiy/109951007615302014) plucking one note repeatedly and hopefully I can get a full demo setup and running in the next week.
