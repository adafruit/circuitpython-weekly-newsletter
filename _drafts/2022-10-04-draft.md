## CircuitPython 8.0.0 Beta.1 Released

[![CircuitPython 8.0.0 Beta.1 Released](../assets/20221004/20221004cp8.jpg)](url)

Adafruit has released **CircuitPython 8.0.0-beta.1**, a beta release for 8.0.0. It is relatively stable, but there will be further additions and fixes before final release.

**Notable changes to 8.0.0 since 7.3.0:**
- Added WiFi workflow with browser-based device discovery, filesystem browsing, upload, download, file editing, serial/REPL connection.
- Added a one-line status bar, which displays connection status, last exception, and version on a terminal window title or on the top line of
an attached display. Support for status bar display is also being added to the Mu and Thonny editors.
- `.env` file in **CIRCUITPY** specifies WiFI connection parameters, BLE name, and other startup values.
- `dotenv` support: `os.getenv()` values can be set in the `.env` file.
- Preliminary implementation of WiFi on the Pi Pico W.
- Revised Espressif camera support, now available on ESP32, ESP32-S2, and ESP32-S3.
- Bulk analog input: `analogbufio` (available only on RP2040 for now).
- Pin state can be preserved during deep sleep (available only on Espressif for now).
- Allow setting USB VID, PID, manufacturer, and product ids at runtime.
- `AnalogIn` values are full range from 0 to 65535, instead of having zeros on low-order bits.
- `OneWire` is only in `onewireio`, and is no longer in `busio` or `bitbangio`.
- `gamepadshift` has been removed: use `keypad.ShiftRegisterKeys` instead.
- `MP3Decoder` and `WaveFile` can now take a filename instead of an open file.
- `PulseOut` no longer accepts a `PWMOut`. Use a `Pin` instead.
- Added `TileGrid.contains()`.
- `i2ctarget.I2CTarget` is the new name for `i2cperipheral.I2CPeripheral`. Accept both for now. `I2CPeripheral` will be removed in 9.0.0.
- Auto-brightness support in `displayio` and `framebufferio` has been removed. It was never implemented completely.
- Restored `rainbowio` and `onewireio` to a number of boards.
- Print out whole-number floats exactly and correctly.
- Enabled `collections.deque` on most builds.

## Hacktoberfest 2022

[![Hacktoberfest 2022](../assets/20221004/20221004hack.jpg)](https://hacktoberfest.com/)

Hacktoberfest 2022 is here! Whether it's your first time or not, it's time to hack out four (or more) pristine open source pull/merge requests. All of October, DigitalOcean sponsors Hacktoberfest - [Hacktoberfest](https://hacktoberfest.com/).

## USB Simplifies Branding

[![USB simplifies branding](../assets/20221004/20221004usb.jpg)](https://blog.adafruit.com/2022/09/30/usb-simplifies-branding-but-reintroduces-active-cables-usb-tidbits/)

Every time the USB Implementers Forum posted a new set of logos describing ever more USB speeds, electrical power possibilities, and display parameters, it resulted in an outpouring of confusion, ridicule, and anger — yes, anger. But at long last, the USB-IF has finally made things better, with a simplified set of USB logos!

> Instead of forcing consumers to use versioning terminology such as USB 3.2 Gen 2×2 or messing around with marketing terms like “SuperSpeed+,” the USB-IF has simplified things so you can now just write something like “USB 20Gbps.” The version details still exist and have meaning for developers and engineers, but most of the consumer-level branding now boils down to just the following four packaging labels, indicating the maximum supported data rate.

A similar set of logos will appear on cable plugs. As USB data rates and standards’ names became more complicated, the options for charging wattage have been distilled down to just two: 60 watts and 240 watts, with future USB chargers using the new logos - [Adafruit Blog](https://blog.adafruit.com/2022/09/30/usb-simplifies-branding-but-reintroduces-active-cables-usb-tidbits/) and [TidBITS](https://tidbits.com/2022/09/29/usb-simplifies-branding/).

## What’s the team up to this week?

What is the team up to this week? Let’s check in!

**Dan**

During the past week, I improved the status bar code a bit, making it less likely that partial status bar codes will be output to the REPL. But it may need further work.

I also figured out why CircuitPython on the ESP32 was consuming more power during deep sleep than Arduino. The "pin holding" mechanism in ESP32, which allows setting pin levels during deep sleep, itself consumes extra current when enabled. I now turn it on only when necessary, and the power consumption levels are as expected.

I'll probably release CircuitPython 8.0.0-beta.1 sometime in the next week.

**Kattni**

**Melissa**

This past week I've mostly focused on the [Code Editor](https://code.circuitpython.org/). I added USB Workflow and improved the BLE workflow as well as some bug fixes and UI improvements. There's still a little bit more to do, but it's coming along nicely. I also spent a little time helping Brent get the WipperSnapper LittleFS partitioning working again, which broke due to recent a Board Support Package update.

**Tim**

This week I tested and reviewed a PR with refactored BME280 driver that allows us to cut down on repeated code. I completed some additional testing and fixes for the mpy filesize actions task. During the Deep Dive I tested and showed off a new community library that provides some neat new functionality with displayio.Palette's. It makes it easy to set several similar colors to all be transparent, without any need to manually manually manipulate the palette order within BMP files.

**Jeff**

I split this past week between a Learn project, version 8 bugfixes, and work on the Pico W.

The Learn project is another vintage keyboard to USB converter. This time, it was the Tandy 1000 keyboard. The keyboard uses a clocked serial protocol, which can be captured and decoded by the PIO peripheral of the Adafruit QT Py RP2040. [Check out the guide!](https://learn.adafruit.com/tandy-1000-keyboard-to-usb-with-circuitpython/overview) I was keen to publish this guide in September, which is known in the retrocomputing community as the month of "#SepTandy".

I grabbed and fixed a couple of reported issues in the core, bringing us closer to the next 8.0.0 beta release. Most notably, I upgraded ulab to version 5.1.1, bringing in a number of good bug-fixes and improvements.

Finally, Pico W. I really appreciated the community feedback about this work on the GitHub issue and pull request, as well as on DIscord! I identified and fixed one major bug, which meant sockets stopped working after 8 sockets were ever opened, and marked the Pull Request as ready for review. With any luck, this will be part of the next version 8 beta, and we can get feedback from a wider range of users.

**Liz**

This week I worked on a new product guide for the [ENS160 MOX Gas Sensor](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-ens160-mox-gas-sensor) and a guide to bring the [CLUE Sensor Plotter project into PyLeap](https://learn.adafruit.com/pyleap-clue-sensor-plotter). The [CLUE Sensor Plotter](https://learn.adafruit.com/clue-sensor-plotter-circuitpython) was originally a guide by Kevin Walters and I added the code files to be pulled into PyLeap.
