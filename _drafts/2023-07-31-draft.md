Welcome to the latest Python on Microcontrollers newsletter! Your editor is back and extends thanks to Kattni & Paul for their hard work covering in my stead. xxxx. Finally I'm looking to keep the shift of newsletters being published Monday mornings (US time) so keep an eye on your inboxes every Monday instead of Tuesday *- Anne Barela, Ed.*

We're on [Discord](https://discord.gg/HYqvREz), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/search?q=circuitpython&src=typed_query&f=live), and for past newsletters - [view them all here](https://www.adafruitdaily.com/category/circuitpython/). If you're reading this on the web, [subscribe here](https://www.adafruitdaily.com/). Here's the news this week:

## CircuitPython 8.2.1 Released

[![CircuitPython 8.2.1 Released](../assets/20230731/20230731cp8.jpg)](https://blog.adafruit.com/2023/07/25/circuitpython-8-2-1-released/)

CircuitPython 8.2.1 is now the latest bugfix revision of CircuitPython, and is the new stable release - [Adsafruit Blog](https://blog.adafruit.com/2023/07/25/circuitpython-8-2-1-released/) and [Release Notes](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/releases/tag/8.2.1).

**Notable changes to 8.2.1 since 8.1.0**

- Continued enhancement of `synthio`.
- RP2040 `alarm.sleep_memory`.

Note for nRF52 boards only: If your board has an nRF52 UF2 bootloader whose version is before 0.6.1, you will not be able to load CircuitPython 8.2.0 and later. The 8.2.0 firmware is larger than what the bootloader can handle. See [these instructions](https://learn.adafruit.com/introducing-the-adafruit-nrf52840-feather/update-bootloader) for updating your bootloader.

## What’s the CircuitPython team up to this week?

What is the team up to this week? Let’s check in!

**Dan**

I released CircuitPython 8.2.1 last Tuesday. It has a fix for the newly released MatrixPortal S3, and there are about 15 other changes and fixes, including some new boards.

I'm getting close to actually trying to compile the MicroPython v1.19.1 merge to CircuitPython.

**Kattni**

This week I wrapped up the final newsletter of my editing run. Thanks again to Paul for all the help there. We both greatly appreciate all of you bearing with us and doing amazing things for us to include in our newsletters. 

I also worked on various guide fixes and updates. The biggest update was to the [Contribute to CircuitPython Using Git and GitHub](https://learn.adafruit.com/contribute-to-circuitpython-with-git-and-github) guide. This guide is a first stop for many folks who are new to contributing to CircuitPython or open source projects in general, as well as for experienced folks who are new to contributing to CircuitPython specifically, or are simply interested in how we do things. GitHub updated their user interface in the last couple of years, and we changed how we do our code testing since the guide was written, and, while the info overall was still solid, there were parts of it that were woefully out of date. Not anymore! Everything is now up to date and covers our current testing methods. There's new info on using GitHub Actions, and accepting suggested changes on a pull request through the GitHub interface. Even if you're familiar with this guide, it's worth checking out!

**Melissa**

**Tim**

I've continued learning the ropes for OSHWA certification requests, and have gotten more experience collecting the information and submitting requests. I did testing and reviews for several PRs in the Wiznet5k ethernet, and Requests libraries. I also started submitting changes related to recent updates to bitmaptools from the core.

**Jeff**

This week Ladyada sent me a prototype of the long awaited PyCamera board, which integrates a WiFi microcontroller, 5-megapixel camera and SD card reader, among other goodies. I've been putting it through its paces and fixing bugs that came up along the way.

I also added a small feature to `synthi`o to get information about currently playing notes.

**Scott**


I've been working on mass storage support from CircuitPython. It works on iMX RT with another CircuitPython device connected. My usb flash drive doesn't work yet. RP2040 doesn't work with CircuitPython now either. So, I'm still in the USB host debugging weeds.

I'm starting to host Deep Dives again (when not on dad duty.) They are streamed at 2pm Pacific on Fridays. Thanks to Tim (aka FoamyGuy) for deep diving this past year and filling in for me in the future too.

**Liz**

This week I published a guide for my [4x4 Rotary Encoder MIDI Messenger project](https://learn.adafruit.com/4x4-rotary-encoder-midi-messenger). This project uses four of the quad rotary encoder breakouts. The code is written in CircuitPython and uses `asyncio` along with the interrupt pins on the breakouts to make reading the data from the encoders super responsive. It was my first time using `asyncio` and it definitely won't be the last. I'm looking forward to using it for more complicated projects in the future.
