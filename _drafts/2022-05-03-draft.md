## MicroPython Turns 9 Years Old

[![MicroPython Turns 9](../assets/20220503/20220503mp9.jpg)](https://forum.micropython.org/viewforum.php?f=19&sid=29d69b517a9342e49d5a933b01952b22)

The 29th of April marked the date on which the first line of MicroPython code was written, which is now 9 years ago! Via the MicroPython Newsletter, Issue 12, here are some highlights at this point:

In the past 12 months the main MicroPython code has seen:

* 1210 commits, up from 817 in the previous year (there are now 13393 total commits)
* 147 contributors, up from 93 in the previous year; thank you to all of you!
* And versions v1.16, v1.17 and v1.18 were released.

MicroPython also gained the following new features:

* mpremote, a new command-line tool for interacting with a MicroPython device; find it at [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/mpremote), and read the [documentation](https://docs.micropython.org/en/latest/reference/mpremote.html)
* f-strings (PEP-498)
* additions to the mimxrt port: VFS with internal flash storage, Pin, ADC, UART, Timer, RTC, I2C, SPI, SDRAM, SD card and LAN support
* additions to the rp2 port: RTC, networking and Bluetooth support, more boards
* additions to the samd port: filesystem using internal flash; Pin, LED classes
* machine.I2S on stm32, esp32, rp2 and mimxrt ports
* boosted performance of the VM and runtime by the addition of an optional cache to speed up general hash table lookups
* board.json metadata for each supported board, and corresponding automated building of firmware for the [download page](https://micropython.org/download).
* simplification of configuration of features via a feature level setting, which aims to make the ports more consistent in what Python features they offer
* And many other things!

MicroPython was again part of Google's Season of Docs, for 2021, where there was a new technical writer who added documentation about the rp2 port, detail about the differences between MicroPython and standard Python, and other things.

GitHub Sponsors has been growing well over the past year, and MicroPython is now receiving USD $4150/month, up from USD $1250/month this time last year. This funding is greatly appreciated and goes towards maintaining the open source code. You can find the [sponsorship page here](https://github.com/sponsors/micropython).

It has been a very busy 12 months and things are not slowing down! We plan to release v1.18 very soon, which includes a completely reworked .mpy file format to facilitate freezing Python code without rebuilding firmware. And there are many other items in the works, so keep an eye out for the releases over the coming 12 months!

## New MicroPython Version 1.19 Coming Very Soon

[![MicroPython Version 1.19](../assets/20220503/20220503mp119.jpg)](https://twitter.com/micropython/status/1520052529840758786)

## CircuitPython Libraries!

[![CircuitPython Libraries](../assets/20220503/blinka.png)](https://circuitpython.org/libraries)

CircuitPython support for hardware continues to grow. We are adding support for new sensors and breakouts all the time, as well as improving on the drivers we already have. As we add more libraries and update current ones, you can keep up with all the changes right here!

For the latest libraries, download the [Adafruit CircuitPython Library Bundle](https://circuitpython.org/libraries). For the latest community contributed libraries, download the [CircuitPython Community Bundle](https://github.com/adafruit/CircuitPython_Community_Bundle/releases).

If you'd like to contribute, CircuitPython libraries are a great place to start. Have an idea for a new driver? File an issue on [CircuitPython](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/issues)! Have you written a library you'd like to make available? Submit it to the [CircuitPython Community Bundle](https://github.com/adafruit/CircuitPython_Community_Bundle). Interested in helping with current libraries? Check out the [CircuitPython.org Contributing page](https://circuitpython.org/contributing). We've included open pull requests and issues from the libraries, and details about repo-level issues that need to be addressed. We have a guide on [contributing to CircuitPython with Git and GitHub](https://learn.adafruit.com/contribute-to-circuitpython-with-git-and-github) if you need help getting started. You can also find us in the #circuitpython channels on the [Adafruit Discord](https://adafru.it/discord).

You can check out this [list of all the Adafruit CircuitPython libraries and drivers available](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_Bundle/blob/master/circuitpython_library_list.md). 

The current number of CircuitPython libraries is **###**!

## What’s the team up to this week?

What is the team up to this week? Let’s check in!

**Dan**

I released CircuitPython 7.3.0-beta.2, which includes about three weeks of fixes and improvements. Included are the revised NeoPixel timings I worked on this week.

I'm continuing to debug an ESP32-S2 I2C, together with an Esspressif engineer.

This coming week, I'll be testing the CircuitPython on the ESP32-S3, to see what is currently working and what needs to be fixed.

**Jeff**

Before heading to PyCon, some of my work got merged into the CircuitPython core, including the low-level "floppyio" module. This means you can read raw flux as well as MFM floppy data on SAMD51 and RP2040 microcontrollers in Python! While the accompanying [library](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_floppy)--which does things like control the drive's motors--hasn't been released yet, at least the core code is done and merged.

**Kattni**

[![Kattni](../assets/20220503/20220503kattni.jpg)](https://circuitpython.org/)

**Melissa**

Before heading to PyCon, I was able to get the touch screen drivers working alongside the MIPI drivers on the Raspberry Pi. I prepared a PR and it’s now merged. There are still a couple of small issues to work out. I had fun hanging out with Kattni and Jeff at PyCon and was able to meet a lot of nice folks.

**Tim**

My core PR to allow TileGrids to have their Bitmap changed was merged this week as well as a PR to add a tilegrid inflator helper to the imageload library. With these features now in place we now have everything needed for the SpriteButton and TabLayout displayio widgets that I've been working on. I had my first experience setting up a SharpMemoryDisplay in order to test out a few PRs for the driver library as well as testing out an asyncio library PR with the examples from the learn guide. Over the weekend I'll be watching some of the PyCon talks through their online portal.

**Liz**

This past week I [published a guide](https://learn.adafruit.com/qt-py-rp2040-usb-to-serial-midi-friends) on how to solder up some MIDI friends for the QT Py RP2040. Speaking as someone who ventured into electronics and coding specifically for music tech and MIDI projects, I'm not sure I'll ever get over how straight forward using CircuitPython for MIDI is. 

This coming week I'll be continuing on the laser harp project, some Twitter listener 
CircuitPython code and some new product Learn Guides. I did a [guide using the Twitter API](https://learn.adafruit.com/iot-twitter-listener-party-parrot/overview) back in August 2020 and it's been fun to revisit.
