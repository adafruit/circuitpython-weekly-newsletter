Hi everyone! It's the latest Python for Microcontrollers newsletter, brought you by the community! We're on [Discord](https://discord.gg/HYqvREz), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/search?q=circuitpython&src=typed_query&f=live), and for past newsletters - [view them all here](https://www.adafruitdaily.com/category/circuitpython/). If you're reading this on the web, [subscribe here](https://www.adafruitdaily.com/). Let's get started!

## Headline Article

[![CircuitPython 5.1.0 Released](../assets/20200407/featured.jpg)](https://circuitpython.org/)

CircuitPython 5.1.0 stable was released this week by the CircuitPython development team. This is the latest minor revision of CircuitPython and the first 5.1.x stable release. It is identical to 5.1.0-rc.0.

**New features and improvements since 5.0.0**
- ulab, a numpy-like fast vector module: Perform mathematical operations 10-50x as fast as raw CircuitPython. It is enabled on almost all boards except those with samd21 microcontrollers - [Guide](https://learn.adafruit.com/ulab-crunch-numbers-fast-with-circuitpython/overview)
- Support for “f-strings”, a more convenient way to build strings dynamically. It is enabled on almost all boards except those with samd21 microcontrollers.
- And many more including two new board definitions.

## Adafruit Update

[![Adafruit Heart New York](../assets/03312020/03312020heart.jpg)](https://blog.adafruit.com/2020/03/22/covid/)

Adafruit Industries continues to run with 100% of employees being paid and continuing to work. Most are working remotely, with some working in the Manhattan, New York factory as an essential service and business under NYC Executive Order 202.6 Capabilities. Adafruit was deemed an essential service to manufacture and distribute some PPE (Personal Protection Equipment) such as face shields, and manufacture electronics for essential life-saving/preserving equipment and development which is needed in New York and beyond -[Blog](https://blog.adafruit.com/2020/03/22/covid/).

The CircuitPython team released CircuitPython 5.1.0 stable and work on 5.2.x is underway. Would you like to join us? On Discord, head to https://adafru.it/discord to discuss things. And check out [Awesome CircuitPython](https://github.com/adafruit/awesome-circuitpython/blob/master/README.md) for a wide range of information.

## Made with Mu

Why Mu? Mu tries to make it as easy as possible to get started with programming but aims to help you graduate to "real" development tools soon after. Everything in Mu is the "real thing" but presented in as simple and obvious way possible. It's like the toddling stage in learning to walk: you're finding your feet and once you're confident, you should move on and explore! Put simply, Mu aims to foster autonomy. Try out Mu today! - [codewith.mu](https://codewith.mu/)

**PyPI Download Stats!**

We've written a special library called Adafruit Blinka that makes it possible to use CircuitPython Libraries on [Raspberry Pi and other compatible single-board computers](https://learn.adafruit.com/circuitpython-on-raspberrypi-linux/). Adafruit Blinka and all the CircuitPython libraries have been deployed to PyPI for super simple installation on Linux! Here are the top 10 CircuitPython libraries downloaded from PyPI in the last week, including the total downloads for those libraries:

## Call for help – CircuitPython messaging to other languages!

[![Hello world](../assets/DIR-LOCATION/DATE-helloworld.jpg)](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/issues/1098)

We [recently posted on the Adafruit blog](https://blog.adafruit.com/2018/08/15/help-bring-circuitpython-messaging-to-other-languages-circuitpython/) about bringing CircuitPython messaging to other languages, one of the exciting features of CircuitPython 4 and later versions is translated control and error messages. Native language messages will help non-native English speakers understand what is happening in CircuitPython even though the Python keywords and APIs will still be in English. If you would like to help, [please post](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/issues/1098) to the main issue on GitHub and join us on [Discord](https://adafru.it/discord).

We made this graphic with translated text, we could use your help with that to make sure we got the text right, please check out the text in the image – if there is anything we did not get correct, please let us know. Dan sent me this [handy site too](http://helloworldcollection.de/#Human).

## Codecademy "Learn Hardware Programming with CircuitPython"

[![Codecademy CircuitPython](../assets/DIR-LOCATION/DATE-codecademy_python.png)](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-circuitpython?utm_source=adafruit&utm_medium=partners&utm_campaign=circuitplayground&utm_content=pythononhardwarenewsletter)

Codecademy, an online interactive learning platform used by more than 45 million people, has teamed up with the leading manufacturer in STEAM electronics, Adafruit Industries, to create a coding course, "Learn Hardware Programming with CircuitPython". The course is now available in the [Codecademy catalog](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-circuitpython?utm_source=adafruit&utm_medium=partners&utm_campaign=circuitplayground&utm_content=pythononhardwarenewsletter).

Python is a highly versatile, easy to learn programming language that a wide range of people, from visual effects artists in Hollywood to mission control at NASA, use to quickly solve problems. But you don’t need to be a rocket scientist to accomplish amazing things with it. This new course introduces programmers to Python by way of a microcontroller — CircuitPython — which is a Python-based programming language optimized for use on hardware.

CircuitPython’s hardware-ready design makes it easier than ever to program a variety of single-board computers, and this course gets you from no experience to working prototype faster than ever before. Codecademy’s interactive learning environment, combined with Adafruit's highly rated Circuit Playground Express, present aspiring hardware hackers with a never-before-seen opportunity to learn hardware programming seamlessly online.

Whether for those who are new to programming, or for those who want to expand their skill set to include physical computing, this course will have students getting familiar with Python and creating incredible projects along the way. By the end, students will have built their own bike lights, drum machine, and even a moisture detector that can tell when it's time to water a plant.

Visit Codecademy to access the [Learn Hardware Programming with CircuitPython](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-circuitpython?utm_source=adafruit&utm_medium=partners&utm_campaign=circuitplayground&utm_content=pythononhardwarenewsletter) course and Adafruit to purchase a [Circuit Playground Express](https://www.adafruit.com/product/3333).

Codecademy has helped more than 45 million people around the world upgrade their careers with technology skills. The company’s online interactive learning platform is widely recognized for providing an accessible, flexible, and engaging experience for beginners and experienced programmers alike. Codecademy has raised a total of $43 million from investors including Union Square Ventures, Kleiner Perkins, Index Ventures, Thrive Capital, Naspers, Yuri Milner and Richard Branson, most recently raising its $30 million Series C in July 2016.
