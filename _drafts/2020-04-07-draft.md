## Stanford - a free introductory coding course in Python (short deadline)

[![Code in Place: Free coding education](../assets/20200407/20200407stanford.jpg)](https://compedu.stanford.edu/codeinplace/announcement/)

As an act of community service, a group of Stanford computer science instructors are coming together to offer their teaching services free of charge for people who want to learn introductory coding, subject to availability. This is a one time offering for the COVID-19 pandemic.

Course Dates: April 13th until May 22nd.
Where: Anywhere with internet.
Who: Learners, with no programming experience, and time to dedicate to learning.
**Student application deadline: April 8th, Anywhere on Earth.**
Teacher application deadline: April 3rd, Anywhere on Earth.

The learning experience, called CS106A - Code in Place, will be an introductory programming course using the Python language, using material from the first half of Stanford University's established intro course, CS106A. It assumes no prior programming experience. You should expect to be working 15 to 20 hours a week and you will need an internet connection strong enough to stream video. Code in Place require no previous background in programming---just a willingness to work hard and a love for learning. It requires considerable dedication and hard work, over a course of 5 weeks.
