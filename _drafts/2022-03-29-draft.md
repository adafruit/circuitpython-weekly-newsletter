## New Python Twitter Communities

Twitter Communities is a new feature being rolled out on Twitter to aggregate people with common interests. And there are now two communities related to Python on Microcontrollers:

[![MicroPython Twitter Community](../assets/20220329/20220329mtc.jpg)](https://twitter.com/i/communities/1506567111837159424)

Twitter launched Twitter Communities to give people a dedicated place to connect, share, and get closer to the discussions they care about most. Communities are started and managed by people on Twitter — admins and moderators who enforce Community rules and keep conversations informative, relevant, and fun. People who accept invites to join a Community become members. Tweets in Communities can be seen by anyone on Twitter, but only others within the Community itself can engage and participate in the discussion. 

[![CircuitPython Twitter Community](../assets/20220329/20220329ctc.jpg)](https://twitter.com/i/communities/1506567111837159424)

Two communities related to Python on Hardware now exist: the [Twitter MicroPython Community](https://twitter.com/i/communities/1506567111837159424) and the [CircuitPython Twitter Community](https://twitter.com/i/communities/1506684289622106117).

[More on Twitter Communities](https://help.twitter.com/en/using-twitter/communities) and you can also [search for communities](https://twitter.com/i/communities/suggested) - for example here are [all Python-related communities](https://twitter.com/i/communities/suggested?q=python).

## It's a Boy!

Scott Shawcroft, lead CircuitPython developer, along with his partner have a new baby as of 8:14 a.m. March 25th! Baby and mother are doing well! Scott will be on paternity leave for the next six weeks and the whole Adafruit staff and the Python + Maker communities wish the family well.

## A New Major Thonny Update is in Beta

[![Thonny Editor](../assets/20220329/20220329thonny.jpg)](https://blog.adafruit.com/2022/03/25/thonny-python-editor-gets-4-0-0-beta-release-python-micropython/)

The Thonny Python editor had received a version 4.0.0 beta 1 release. They are looking for help in reporting bugs and bug fixes.

There are many changes since 3.3.13. Here are some notable ones:

* Upgrade bundled Python to 3.10
* Mac bundle now comes with the unversal2 build of Python
* Drop support for Python 3.5, 3.6 and 3.7
* Use [pipkin](https://pypi.org/project/pipkin/) for managing packages on MicroPython and CircuitPython devices. This enables proper listing of packages together with version info and proper uninstallation.
* Automatically interrupt current process when connecting to bare-metal MicroPython or CircuitPython device.
* Add generic “MicroPython (RP2040)” back-end in addition to the more specific “MicroPython (Raspberry Pi Pico)”

## What’s the team up to this week?

What is the team up to this week? Let’s check in!

**Dan**

I've been cleaning up the adafruit_requests library, and am now testing some async additions to it.

Jeff, Scott, and I reviewed the list of near-term bugs to fix in CircuitPython, in preparation for Scott's multi-week leave.

**Jeff**

While I've added good support for imaging non-protected Apple II floppies, I'd like to add support for copy-protected Apple II floppies to Adafruit_Floppy as well. To this end, I've started implementing the ".a2r" format used by Applesauce. This format has good open documentation, as well as some open source software that can use it. I'll continue to work on an open pull request to add support for this format to FluxEngine, and also make sure that it works with the proprietary Applesauce software for macs.

**Kattni**

This week, I worked with Liz (BlitzCityDIY) to walk her through creating new product guides. Her first two guides are live! We also worked on her learning how to do a breakout STEMMA QT revision guide update. She updated her first guide, and is working on updating her second guide on her own. Liz has been doing great!

In between working with Liz, I got through some of the miscellaneous on my list, and a few new things that popped up along the way. The ESP32-S2 CircuitPython Internet Test page has been updated to be standalone and use the Project Bundler, and removed the CircuitPython Internet Libraries page rendered obsolete by the update. I updated a few things on the Feather ESP32-S2 guide to reflect the new revision of the board. I updated the Adafruit IO template WiFi code to be more robust and not crash on disconnection.

As well, I submitted my first PR to MicroPython to expose pin 20 on the ESP32 so it works with the Feather ESP32 V2. It was merged!

**Melissa**

This past week I started working on a couple of guides for displays. This included updating the Arduino Display libraries and adding board-specific examples so there is less fussing with initializers such as [this 1.47" ImageReader example](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_ImageReader/tree/master/examples/BreakoutST7789-172x320). I'm actually updating the format of the guide a bit so that some past guides can be revised to use the same format. I'm hoping it will be even more helpful to users than the previous format was in the past.

**Tim**

This week I dove into the CircuitPython core module `vectorio` to add a new feature allowing the user code to set the color index within the palette to use for coloring the shapes. I reviewed and tested some more PRs including some typing PRs from a few newer contributors to the libraries. I also started building some Python level helper classes on top of `vectorio` objects. So far the ones available are a line with settable stroke size, an outlined rectangle with a border around it, and a rotatable polygon that allows you to specify arbitrary rotations in degrees and handles all of the math to find the new points to make up the polygon.

**Liz**

I worked with Kattni to get the VL53L4CD and MCP23017 new product guides live. She also showed me how to do the updated product guides and we updated the Analog Devices ADXL343 guide. 

I also worked on a project guide for a Raspberry Pi Video Synth. The hardware is controlled with Blinka and the animations are running with Processing. The Python and Processing scripts are communicating together with a socket. I think that that is one of the most useful aspects of the project and will hopefully be useful for folks who want to use CircuitPython on a Raspberry Pi to communicate with other programming languages. 

**Scott**

This week I've been wrapping up pending code and taking on small tasks. My partner and I are about to have a baby so I'm not getting myself into anything too big.

I added mDNS support to ESP builds. I added support for the USB to Serial/JTAG on the C3 so it can be used for CircuitPython serial. I just made a PR to support the ESP32-S3 USB-OTG devkit from Espressif. I also cleaned up a bunch of board definitions prior to that so that we wouldn't keep duplicating unnecessary settings.

I'll keep picking up small tasks or continue brainstorming for the [web workflow](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/issues/6174) until the baby arrives. After that, I'll be out six weeks.
