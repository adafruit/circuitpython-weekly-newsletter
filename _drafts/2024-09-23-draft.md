## New Boards Supported by CircuitPython

The number of supported microcontrollers and Single Board Computers (SBC) grows every week. This section outlines which boards have been included in CircuitPython or added to [CircuitPython.org](https://circuitpython.org/).

This week, there were (#/no) new boards added:

- [Board name](url)
- [Board name](url)
- [Board name](url)

*Note: For non-Adafruit boards, please use the support forums of the board manufacturer for assistance, as Adafruit does not have the hardware to assist in troubleshooting.*

Looking to add a new board to CircuitPython? It's highly encouraged! Adafruit has four guides to help you do so:

- [How to Add a New Board to CircuitPython](https://learn.adafruit.com/how-to-add-a-new-board-to-circuitpython/overview)
- [How to add a New Board to the circuitpython.org website](https://learn.adafruit.com/how-to-add-a-new-board-to-the-circuitpython-org-website)
- [Adding a Single Board Computer to PlatformDetect for Blinka](https://learn.adafruit.com/adding-a-single-board-computer-to-platformdetect-for-blinka)

## CircuitPython Libraries

[![CircuitPython Libraries](../assets/20240923/blinka.png)](https://circuitpython.org/libraries)

The CircuitPython library numbers are continually increasing, while existing ones continue to be updated. Here we provide library numbers and updates!

To get the latest Adafruit libraries, download the [Adafruit CircuitPython Library Bundle](https://circuitpython.org/libraries). To get the latest community contributed libraries, download the [CircuitPython Community Bundle](https://circuitpython.org/libraries).

If you'd like to contribute to the CircuitPython project on the Python side of things, the libraries are a great place to start. Check out the [CircuitPython.org Contributing page](https://circuitpython.org/contributing). If you're interested in reviewing, check out Open Pull Requests. If you'd like to contribute code or documentation, check out Open Issues. We have a guide on [contributing to CircuitPython with Git and GitHub](https://learn.adafruit.com/contribute-to-circuitpython-with-git-and-github), and you can find us in the #help-with-circuitpython and #circuitpython-dev channels on the [Adafruit Discord](https://adafru.it/discord).

You can check out this [list of all the Adafruit CircuitPython libraries and drivers available](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_Bundle/blob/master/circuitpython_library_list.md). 

The current number of CircuitPython libraries is **###**!

## What’s the CircuitPython team up to this week?

**Jeff**

I've been going module by module to make sure the functionality of the RP2350 chip, particularly on the Pico 2, is working.

One problem I found and resolved actually affected the RP2040 as well: the timing of neopixel data in adafruit_neopxl8 was not quite right, with all pulses being somewhat shorter than they should have been. This is now fixed and an updated version of the lib will likely be released shortly.

**Scott**

This week I've fixed a number of issues on the ESP32 series of chips and one on nRF. The fixes are in 9.1.4 and 9.2.0-beta.0. Thanks to Dan for releasing those. I'm finally back to working on CircuitMatter. I starting to work on commissioning and am currently figuring out how to encrypt my reply so the commissioner can decrypt it.

**Liz**

This week I've been working on a few product guides. The first is for the [Adafruit DS2482S-800 8 Channel I2C to 1-Wire Bus Adapter](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-ds2482s-800-8-channel-i2c-to-1-wire-bus-adapter). This breakout lets you use up to 8 1-Wire sensors over I2C and intead of having to know the ROM address of the sensors, you can call them out by channel. I updated the CircuitPython library to be able to handle passing a ROM address or channel number to the DS18B20 temperature function.

I have also been working on the Feather RP2350 guide. I have a few more pages to take care of now that Arduino support has been merged into the Philhower Arduino BSP but it should be wrapped up and ready to show off next week.

I have also been using the new itsaSnap iOS app with Apple Shortcuts. This lets you use your phone to send data to Adafruit IO. I've been having a lot of fun working with shortcuts and have a few projects ideas that I'm starting to work on. If you want a sample of what you can do, check out [Trevor's new weather display guide](https://learn.adafruit.com/itsasnap-daily-weather-forecast-board). It uses CircuitPython on a Matrix Portal S3 with Apple Shortcuts and itsaSnap to send weather data from iOS to Adafruit IO and then display the data on the RGB matrix. I think this is a really cool use of itsaSnap because usually getting weather data can be cumbersome with API requests and API keys.
