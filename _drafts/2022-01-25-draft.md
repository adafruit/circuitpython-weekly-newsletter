## The Raspberry Pi Pico / RP2040 Turns One Year Old

[![Pico](../assets/20220125/20220125pico.jpg)](https://www.raspberrypi.com/news/multilingual-blink-for-raspberry-pi-pico/)

ABout a year ago, Raspberry Pi released a new type of product - their first microcontroller: the RP2040 and a devevelopment board which uses it: the Raspberry Pi Pico. Usage by the electronics and hobbyist community has been quick due to great functionality at a great price point (and it has generally remained available during the silicon shortage).

Maker companies were quick to release RP2040 boards of their own, including Adafruit, SparkFun, Pimoroni and many more as well as smaller companies and individuals. Scaores of designs rely on this versitile chip to perform some remarkable tasks. With lots of RAM, Flash, dual cores, and user programmable PIO, this chip packs a punch.

Read an excellent article by Alasdair Allen which discusses MicroPython and CircuitPython - [RaspberryPi.com](https://www.raspberrypi.com/news/multilingual-blink-for-raspberry-pi-pico/).

## A Study in the Popularity of the CircuitPython GitHub Repository

[![CircuitPython GitHub Repository Popularity](../assets/20220125/20220125star.jpg)](https://star-history.com/#adafruit/circuitpython&Date)

An interesting look at the number of GitHub Stars awarded to the Adafruit [CircuitPython GitHub repo](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython). Marked increases on the dates that the Adafruit PyPortal (2019) and the Raspberry Pi Pico (2021) were released. CircuitPython enjoys increased usage in many segments of the embedded ecosphere - [Star-History](https://star-history.com/#adafruit/circuitpython&Date).

## New Boards Supported by CircuitPython

The number of supported microcontrollers and Single Board Computers (SBC) grows every week. This section outlines which boards have been included in CircuitPython or added to [CircuitPython.org](https://circuitpython.org/).

This week, there were (#/no) new boards added!

- [Board name](url)
- [Board name](url)
- [Board name](url)

*Note: For non-Adafruit boards, please use the support forums of the board manufacturer for assistance, as Adafruit does not have the hardware to assist in troubleshooting.*

Looking to add a new board to CircuitPython? It's highly encouraged! Adafruit has four guides to help you do so:

- [How to Add a New Board to CircuitPython](https://learn.adafruit.com/how-to-add-a-new-board-to-circuitpython/overview)
- [How to add a New Board to the circuitpython.org website](https://learn.adafruit.com/how-to-add-a-new-board-to-the-circuitpython-org-website)

## CircuitPython Libraries!

[![CircuitPython Libraries](../assets/20220125/blinka.png)](https://circuitpython.org/libraries)

CircuitPython support for hardware continues to grow. We are adding support for new sensors and breakouts all the time, as well as improving on the drivers we already have. As we add more libraries and update current ones, you can keep up with all the changes right here!

For the latest libraries, download the [Adafruit CircuitPython Library Bundle](https://circuitpython.org/libraries). For the latest community contributed libraries, download the [CircuitPython Community Bundle](https://github.com/adafruit/CircuitPython_Community_Bundle/releases).

If you'd like to contribute, CircuitPython libraries are a great place to start. Have an idea for a new driver? File an issue on [CircuitPython](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/issues)! Have you written a library you'd like to make available? Submit it to the [CircuitPython Community Bundle](https://github.com/adafruit/CircuitPython_Community_Bundle). Interested in helping with current libraries? Check out the [CircuitPython.org Contributing page](https://circuitpython.org/contributing). We've included open pull requests and issues from the libraries, and details about repo-level issues that need to be addressed. We have a guide on [contributing to CircuitPython with Git and Github](https://learn.adafruit.com/contribute-to-circuitpython-with-git-and-github) if you need help getting started. You can also find us in the #circuitpython channels on the [Adafruit Discord](https://adafru.it/discord).

You can check out this [list of all the Adafruit CircuitPython libraries and drivers available](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_Bundle/blob/master/circuitpython_library_list.md). 

The current number of CircuitPython libraries is **344**!
