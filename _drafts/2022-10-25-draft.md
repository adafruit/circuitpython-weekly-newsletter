## CircuitPython 8.0.0 Beta 3 Released

[![CircuitPython 8.0.0 Beta 3](../assets/20221025/20221025cp8.jpg)](https://blog.adafruit.com/2022/10/20/circuitpython-8-0-0-beta-3-released/)

Developers have released CircuitPython 8.0.0-beta.3, a beta release for 8.0.0. It is relatively stable, but there will be further additions and fixes before final release  - [Adafruit Blog](https://blog.adafruit.com/2022/10/20/circuitpython-8-0-0-beta-3-released/).

**NOTE: ESP32-C3** board builds are not functional since 8.0.0-beta.2. Use 8.0.0-beta.1.

**Notable changes to 8.0.0 since 7.3.0**

* Added WiFi workflow with browser-based device discovery, filesystem browsing, upload, download, file editing, serial/REPL connection (available only on Espressif for now).
* Added a one-line status bar, which displays connection status, last exception, and version on a terminal window title or on the top line of an attached display. Support for status bar display is also being added to the Mu and Thonny editors.
* `.env` file in CIRCUITPY specifies WiFI connection parameters, BLE name, and other startup values.
* `dotenv` support: `os.getenv()` values are set by values in `.env` file. Values can be fetched from other dotenv-format files.
* WiFi functionality implemented on the Pi Pico W.
* Revised Espressif camera support, now available on ESP32, ESP32-S2, and ESP32-S3.

* Pin state can be preserved during deep sleep (available only on Espressif for now).
* Allow setting USB VID, PID, manufacturer, and product ids at runtime.
* Enabled `collections.deque` on most builds.
* `MP3Decoder` and `WaveFile` can now take a filename instead of an open file.
* `AnalogIn` values are full range from 0 to 65535, instead of having zeros on low-order bits.
* In-place firmware update (`dualbank`) capability may be disabled in favor of a larger CIRCUITPY drive.
* Added `TileGrid.contains()`.
* Added `os.utime()`.
* Added `coproc` module, for running programs on an on-chip co-processor. Currently available for the RISC-V core on the ESP32-S2 and ESP32-S3.

The Espressif DevCon22 was last week. Adafruit's Limor "Ladyada" Fried had a discussion about CircuitPython in Part 1 at [9:35:14](https://youtu.be/8l29cTFS27w) - [Part 1](https://youtu.be/8l29cTFS27w) and [Part 2](https://youtu.be/BgRzpbZM5QY).

## Adafruit Monster Eyes Ported to the RP2040 Microcontroller

[![Adafruit Monster Eyes Ported](../assets/20221025/20221025eyes.gif)](https://twitter.com/MarkKomus/status/1584240879916969984)

Mark Komus has ported the Adafruit eyes animation code, originally written for SAMD21/51 microcontrollers, to run on RP2040 boards like the Raspberry Pi Pico. It uses DMA on one or two SPI peripherals (depending on how many eyes you animate) for speed. "The RP2040 code will use two cores for both eyes but the performance is not quite as great as the M4. My guess is the floating point unit in the M4 just gives it that extra kick." - [Twitter](https://twitter.com/MarkKomus/status/1584240879916969984) and [GitHub](https://github.com/gamblor21/Monster_Eyes_RP2040).

### Chip Shortage: TDK Invensense MPU-6050 6_DOF Accelerometer + Gyroscope

[![Chip Shortage](../assets/20221025/20221025cs.jpg)](https://blog.adafruit.com/2022/10/20/chip-shortage-tdk-invensense-mpu-6050-chipshortage-tdk-invensense-adafruit/)

Chip Shortage is a feature video by Adafruit’s Ladyada to highlight items that are in short supply or possibly “unobtainium” (with no known return date to the market). This week it is the [Invensense MPU-6050](https://invensense.tdk.com/products/motion-tracking/6-axis/mpu-6050/). [Digi-Key](https://www.digikey.com/en/products/detail/tdk-invensense/MPU-6050/40380098).

Used in the [Adafruit MPU-6050 6-DoF Accel and Gyro Sensor – STEMMA QT Qwiic breakout board](https://www.adafruit.com/product/3886)

Adafruit ordered 10K in May 2022 – ETA May 2023! - [Adafruit Blog](https://blog.adafruit.com/2022/10/20/chip-shortage-tdk-invensense-mpu-6050-chipshortage-tdk-invensense-adafruit/) and [YouTube](https://youtu.be/AwXmnFH4LeY).

## Project of the Week: Faster CircuitPython LED Animations with ulab

[![Faster CircuitPython LED Animations](../assets/20221025/20221025ulab.gif)](https://twitter.com/todbot/status/1583524068963164160)

Tod writes about achieving a 10x speedup on NeoPixel LED animations in CircuitPython using the Numpy-like ulab library - [Twitter](https://twitter.com/todbot/status/1583524068963164160), [Blog](https://todbot.com/blog/2022/10/21/speed-up-circuitpython-led-animations-10x/) and [Code](https://github.com/todbot/circuitpython_led_effects).

For a simple fire animation that was optimized, the results are striking:

* fire_no_ulab.py: ~40 milliseconds per frame for 256 LEDs on an RP2040
* fire_with_ulab.py: ~4 milliseconds per frame for 256 LEDs on an RP2040

> The technique is to create a “working copy” of the LED data in a ulab/numpy array, and use ulab functions as much as possible. Then at the last possible moment, copy the info from the working copy to the real LEDs object. It only adds a few lines of code to existing solutions and you get access to all tehse cool ulab array functions! (It would be really cool if the neopixel object could take a ulab array to avoid this copy).

## What’s the team up to this week?

What is the team up to this week? Let’s check in!

**Dan**

I released CircuitPython 8.0.0-beta.3 on October 20. This has some more Pico W WiFi additions and fixes from Jeff. It also fixes some ESP32 board builds that would not run. I'm still working on figuring out why our ESP32-C3 builds stopped working after an update to the Espressif ESP-IDF library, which we use for all Espressif ports. The update fixed a bunch of WiFi problems, but also broke the C3 builds, apparently due to a compiler update.

We are whittling down the remaining issues for 8.0.0 final, but a couple of dozen remain.

**Kattni**

I'm back this week after a couple of weeks out sick. I finished up the LTR-329 and LTR-303 light sensors guide. This guide has everything you need to get started with your LTR-329 or LTR-303. Next up is the PCF8575 guide. The breakout is very similar to its cousin the PCF8574 which already has a guide, so this should prove to be a quick one.

**Melissa**

This past week I spent some time working on a guide for the live stream robot build I did on CircuitPython day. I also merged in some new [Blinka boards](https://circuitpython.org/blinka). We’re almost up to 100 now.

**Tim**

This week I was working on some Trivia games that run on Pico W to try out the recently implemented wifi support. I found and documented an issue with returning large responses bigger than a certain size from an HTTPServer. As a short term fix I submitted a change for the HTTPServer library to send smaller chunks when it writes to the socket. The limit turned out to be a deeper issue inside the core and was resolved there within a few days.

**Jeff**

I've continued whittling away at user-reported problems with the Pico W. However, for about two days this week we put my CircuitPython work on hold so that I could [port Doom to a candy bar](https://blog.adafruit.com/2022/10/21/parents-please-carefully-inspect-your-kids-halloween-candy/). It's not playable (there are no controls, so it just loops the demo videos), but the demos run great; you can get the (binary and source code on Adafruit's GitHub)[https://github.com/adafruit/esp32-s3-boy_fw].

**Liz**

I published the [Quick-Start the Pico W WiFi with CircuitPython guide](https://learn.adafruit.com/pico-w-wifi-with-circuitpython). I was excited to finish it up for the weekend as 8.0.0-beta2 was released in case folks were doing weekend hacking with the Pico W. The guide has examples for a basic WiFi test, the Adafruit quotes API, the OpenWeatherMap API, Twitter API, Adafruit IO and Azure IoT Central. I also included a page on using Environmental Variables, aka an .env file, in place of secrets.py for credentials since that concept was a little confusing to me at first.

I also worked on a new product guide for the [PCA9548 I2C multiplexer](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-pca9548-8-channel-stemma-qt-qwiic-i2c-multiplexer). This board is really cool because it has STEMMA QT connectors making it solderless. I also [updated the TCA9548A guide](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-tca9548a-1-to-8-i2c-multiplexer-breakout/circuitpython-python) to include a page on usage with CircuitPython.
