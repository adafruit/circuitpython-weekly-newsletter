[![synthio Tricks](../assets/20230724/20230724-synthio-todbot.jpg)](https://github.com/todbot/circuitpython-synthio-tricks)

CircuitPython only recently added music synthesis using the new `synthio` module. Tod Kurt has been testing `synthio` since early in its development and has written an extensive guide to using `synthio`.

It covers what is `synthio`, which boards work with it, building audio circuits, playing chords, and both basic and advanced techniques. He includes wiring diagrams and code samples to help you learn `synthio`. - [GitHub](https://github.com/todbot/circuitpython-synthio-tricks).

## Project of the Week: CircuitPython powered Typewriter

[![CircuitPython Powered Typewriter](../assets/20230724/20230724-cptypewriter.jpg)](https://fosstodon.org/@mlupo/110709796354267099)

Max Lupo created a custom PCB that connects to a KB2040 running CircuitPython to control a Swintec 1146 typewriter.

The CircuitPython code on the KB2040 blips out a sequence of binary data into the typewriter's parallel port, one character at a time. When the typewriter receives a newline, it tells the code it's busy and taps out its text buffer. - [Mastodon](https://fosstodon.org/@mlupo/110709796354267099) and [GitHub](https://github.com/mlupo/type-type).

[![Weedkiller](../assets/20230724/20230724-weedkiller.jpg)](https://www.raspberrypi.com/news/ai-weed-killer-uses-sunlight-and-raspberry-pi/)

Nathan used a Raspberry Pi 3, camera, motors, Fresnel lens, and photoresistors to build a robot that detects and kills weeds. The Raspberry Pi is mounted underneath and when it detects a weed the motors flip out the giant lens and positions it to kill the weed. The photoresistors track the direction the light is coming and helps focus the sun's beam through the lens. It knows what a weed is based on the TensorFlow image classification model that was used to teach the robot. - [Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.com/news/ai-weed-killer-uses-sunlight-and-raspberry-pi/).

## New Boards Supported by CircuitPython

The number of supported microcontrollers and Single Board Computers (SBC) grows every week. This section outlines which boards have been included in CircuitPython or added to [CircuitPython.org](https://circuitpython.org/).

This week, there were no new boards added!

*Note: For non-Adafruit boards, please use the support forums of the board manufacturer for assistance, as Adafruit does not have the hardware to assist in troubleshooting.*

Looking to add a new board to CircuitPython? It's highly encouraged! Adafruit has four guides to help you do so:

- [How to Add a New Board to CircuitPython](https://learn.adafruit.com/how-to-add-a-new-board-to-circuitpython/overview)

## What’s the CircuitPython team up to this week?

What is the team up to this week? Let’s check in!

**Dan**

I'm still working on the MicroPython v1.19.1 merge to CircuitPython. I made one pass through the merge and am now revisiting the changes, now that I have the context for everything.

It looks like we'll be doing a CircuitPython 8.2.1 with some necessary fixes soon.

I visited the [Center for Engineering Education and Outreach at Tufts University](https://www.ceeoinnovations.org/fetlab/) today, on the invitation of Prof. Chris Rogers, to let the summer student interns play with some CircuitPython boards. I've been there several times. They are using MicroPython, CircuitPython, AdafruitIO, LEGO robotics, and similar technologies to improve engineering education from kindergarten up through college. It's always fun to visit and see what they're up to.

**Kattni**

This week I continued to work through guide feedback, and kept up with making sure this newsletter was ready to go. Turns out when I'm down to the most difficult feedback to resolve, it can literally be a full-time job!

**Melissa**

This past week I finished writing a learn guide for the MatrixPortal S3. The guide is currently in moderation, so keep an eye out for it to be published soon.

I also attended [Open Sauce](https://opensauce.live/) in San Francisco. If you were there, I hope I had a chance to meet you.

**Tim**

I didn't get as much CircuitPython activity as usual due to a power outage at my home over a chunk of time where I normally work and stream CircuitPython related things. The work I did get into after the power returned was following up on Library PR Reviews, and learning the ropes on how to prepare the data to submit to OSHWA for certification of open source hardware.

**Jeff**

I've worked on supporting SD card interfacing using the faster SDIO protocol on the RP2040 microcontroller. This would be handy on an upcoming board from Adafruit, as well some other boards like the Pimoroni Pico DV Base.

Raspberry Pi has provided some code in their repository called "pico-extras"; I've cleaned it up and made it suitable for inclusion in CircuitPython. However, it's not super stable (frequently corrupts the SD card when writing files) and is unable to determine the capacity of the SD card, so it's not going to be immediately added into CircuitPython.

The code is [on my github](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/compare/main...jepler:circuitpython:rp2-sdioio?expand=1) if you want to check it out, but don't expect it to work properly yet!

For the moment, our goal of verifying that this RP2040 Metro board design is correct for 4-bit SDIO is satisfied.

**Scott**

This last week has been overwhelmed by "just started daycare" sickness. So, I haven't done a bunch. I was a bit distracted by Jeff finding [color bitmap emoji from the Serenity OS project](https://chaos.social/@linusgroh/110729628638311045). My [PR](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/pull/8182) to fix the usb_host.Port initialization was merged. I've found a caching issue on the iMX and will have [fix](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/pull/8187) for that shortly too. These issues were found as I try to add support for usb mass storage device (aka usb thumb drives) on the iMX.

**Liz**

This week I wrote a guide for the new [Audio BFF breakout](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-audio-bff). This breakout has an I2S amp and micro SD card slot that can attach directly to a QT Py board. I think it could make for a really great tiny music player.
