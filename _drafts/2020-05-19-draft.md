**PyPI Download Stats!**

We've written a special library called Adafruit Blinka that makes it possible to use CircuitPython Libraries on [Raspberry Pi and other compatible single-board computers](https://learn.adafruit.com/circuitpython-on-raspberrypi-linux/). Adafruit Blinka and all the CircuitPython libraries have been deployed to PyPI for super simple installation on Linux! Here are the top 10 CircuitPython libraries downloaded from PyPI in the last week, including the total downloads for those libraries:

Keep an eye out for updated download stats coming soon!

## What’s the team up to this week?

What is the team up to this week? Let’s check in!

**Bryan**

Still on the filter game from last week, this week I added Arduino library support for the high pass filters in the LIS331 Accelerometers. That wrapped up the Arduino library for now so by the time you read this is should be released. As opposed to low-pass filters that narrow down the data to focus on slower and steady acceleration measurements like orientation detection, a high-pass filter will filter out static or slowly changing data like the acceleration from gravity to focus on dynamic acceleration signals coming from movement of the device being measured. This diagram from an [LIS331 application note](https://www.st.com/resource/en/application_note/cd00215823-lis331dlh-2-g-4-g-8-g-digital-output-high-performance-ultra-lowpower-3axis-accelerometer-stmicroelectronics.pdf) shows how a high-pass filter alters the data being output when compared to the raw signal

[![Bryan](../assets/20200519/bryan1.jpg)](https://circuitpython.org/)

With the Arduino library taken care of and pointing the way, I then went on to write the CircuitPython library. In terms of core functionality both libraries have the same feature set, however with the CircuitPython library we make use of things like data descriptors and properties to be more “Pythonic” in how the user interacts with the library. More generally we also make the library a bit more high level to better match the expectations of Python and CircuitPython users.

[![CircuitPython.org](../assets/20200519/bryan2.jpg)](https://circuitpython.org/libraries)

And it’s available now! You can grab it in the [latest bundle](https://circuitpython.org/libraries) if you're using a device running CircuitPython, or [on PyPi](https://pypi.org/project/adafruit-circuitpython-lis331/) if you're using it [on a Raspberry Pi](https://learn.adafruit.com/circuitpython-on-raspberrypi-linux) or other [Blinka supported computer](https://circuitpython.org/blinka). The guide for the upcoming LIS331 sensors will be available shortly as I'm working on it now, and the sensors themselves should be available not long after that. 

**Dan**

[![Dan](../assets/20200519/dan.jpg)](https://circuitpython.org/)

The [Adafruit BLE Services library](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_BLE_Adafruit) is done. It provides BLE services that work with the [Bluefruit Playground app](https://learn.adafruit.com/bluefruit-playground-app) and the [Bluefruit Web Dashboard](https://learn.adafruit.com/bluefruit-dashboard-web-bluetooth-chrome). You'll be also able to use the library to build custom clients and servers to send whatever sensor or control data you want. I've written CircuitPython programs for the Circuit Playground Bluefruit, the CLUE, and the Feather Bluefruit Sense that communicate with the app. Stay tuned for new Learn Guides about this library.

Along the way I worked with Antonio, the app developer, to debug and fix some minor bugs on both sides of the code.

This week I'll start looking at implementing **\_bleio** using the **bleak** library on host computers.

**Jeff**

Continuing my quest to make SD cards work better in CircuitPython, I've put my attention on the STM32F405 Feather.  This board uses "SDIO" instead of "SPI" to connect the SD card.  Right now, I'm studying how the code needs to be restructured to allow both kinds of connection.

[![Jeff](../assets/20200519/jeff.jpg)](https://circuitpython.org/)

I also worked on fixing several bugs in the last beta release of CircuitPython.  These bugs were related to audio and gamepad functionality, and the fixes should be in the next unstable release after 5.4.0-beta.0.

**Kattni**

Last week I finished up the first major sweep of the CircuitPython library GitHub issues. I intend to do another quick sweep this coming week or next to close out any that did not receive further activity where a response was requested. The plan moving forward is to do a full sweep every so often so we can do a better job keeping up with everything. It's ok for issues to remain open for lengthy periods, but we want to ensure that's happening for a reason and not simply because they've been missed.

Since then, I've been working on the Adafruit CircuitPython LED Animation library. We initially implemented a few simple animations. Over the holiday season, my partner and I had a decorated tree that included over 300 NeoPixel LEDs and it displayed a number of different and improved animations. We started a PR for it, however, we were using pixebuf, a feature of CircuitPython that moves RGB LED math into the core which makes it incredibly fast and efficient. Unfortunately, pixelbuf was not yet implemented and without it, the newer animations were slow and almost unusable, so the PR sat. Recently, the work necessary to implement pixelbuf was completed, so it was finally time to revisit the LED Animation updates. I dusted off the tree code and have been working on implementing the rest of the features. I'm getting close to having the PR ready - it's mostly feature-complete, but it still needs some cleanup - and then I'll be starting on a guide to using the library!

**Lucian**

This week I've been working on some cleanup within the i.MX port - this has included implementing the pin-claiming system, which prevents peripherals from conflicting with each other, and allowing the various BusIO peripherals to work in one-directional setups. I'll be continuing that work this week, and will hopefully get into the guts of the timers soon to get PulseIO working more completely. I've chatted with Arturo about getting one of the new i.MX feathers sent over for testing here in the states, and I'm looking forward to putting it through the paces once it arrives. 

In STM32 land, I fixed an unpleasant but fortunately temporary bug that was causing the Feather F405 to hang on startup, and I'm looking at getting some work done on the RGB matrix done this week as well. I was hoping to demo a robotics-related circuitpython project today, but unfortunately the power cable's been delayed for COVID related reasons... it'll just have to wait until next week.

**Melissa**

[![Melissa](../assets/20200519/melissa.jpg)](https://circuitpython.org/)

This past week, I've been working on adding support for the GreatFET One to Blinka. This board has more than just a lot of GPIOs. It supports Pulse Width Modulation, Analog Input and Output, I2C, SPI, and UART. I was able to write a wrapper for the GreatFET library so Blinka is able to use many of the libraries available. I'm hoping this helps anybody else who happens to also own a GreatFET and wants to get started with unlocking its potential.

With all of the new releases of CircuitPython coming out, there have been a bunch of new boards with support added. I went through and added and resized images for each one and linked those to each of the boards.

**Scott**

By the end of last week I got CircuitPython on ESP32S2 doing basic blinky, the stream is on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LfUBOF1AWzs).

The start of this week I got sucked into finishing our doc switch from restructured text to inline Python stubs. This will enable editors to do better auto-complete for native CircuitPython APIs. The second half of this week will focus on getting the ESP32S2 initial work ready for merge.

**Miguel**
