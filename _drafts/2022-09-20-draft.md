## Maker Becky Stern has a new Electronic Video Series for Digi-Key

[![Becky Stern does new electronic video series](../assets/20220920/20220920becky.jpg)](https://blog.adafruit.com/2022/09/15/maker-becky-stern-does-new-electronic-video-series-for-digi-key-making-digikey-bekathwia/)

Former Adafruit Director of Wearable Electronics Becky Stern has a new video series that she’s doing for [Digi-Key](https://www.digikey.com/). Becky has always done an outstanding job of explaining what can be intimidating technically in an entertaining and digestible way (like her [Adafruit Learning System guides](https://learn.adafruit.com/search?q=becky)).

If this first installment of the series ([playlist in progress](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7LFZxQcCQo&list=PLEBQazB0HUyTF7kB7v1S77F9QK0gT--Kt)), an [introduction to LEDs](https://youtu.be/i7LFZxQcCQo), is any indication, this series looks to deliver more of her welcome brand of accessible tech education.

## New Boards Supported by CircuitPython

The number of supported microcontrollers and Single Board Computers (SBC) grows every week. This section outlines which boards have been included in CircuitPython or added to [CircuitPython.org](https://circuitpython.org/).

This week, there were (#/no) new boards added!

- [Board name](url)
- [Board name](url)
- [Board name](url)

*Note: For non-Adafruit boards, please use the support forums of the board manufacturer for assistance, as Adafruit does not have the hardware to assist in troubleshooting.*

Looking to add a new board to CircuitPython? It's highly encouraged! Adafruit has four guides to help you do so:

- [How to Add a New Board to CircuitPython](https://learn.adafruit.com/how-to-add-a-new-board-to-circuitpython/overview)
- [How to add a New Board to the circuitpython.org website](https://learn.adafruit.com/how-to-add-a-new-board-to-the-circuitpython-org-website)

## CircuitPython Libraries!

[![CircuitPython Libraries](../assets/20220920/blinka.png)](https://circuitpython.org/libraries)

CircuitPython support for hardware continues to grow. We are adding support for new sensors and breakouts all the time, as well as improving on the drivers we already have. As we add more libraries and update current ones, you can keep up with all the changes right here!

For the latest libraries, download the [Adafruit CircuitPython Library Bundle](https://circuitpython.org/libraries). For the latest community contributed libraries, download the [CircuitPython Community Bundle](https://github.com/adafruit/CircuitPython_Community_Bundle/releases).

If you'd like to contribute, CircuitPython libraries are a great place to start. Have an idea for a new driver? File an issue on [CircuitPython](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/issues)! Have you written a library you'd like to make available? Submit it to the [CircuitPython Community Bundle](https://github.com/adafruit/CircuitPython_Community_Bundle). Interested in helping with current libraries? Check out the [CircuitPython.org Contributing page](https://circuitpython.org/contributing). We've included open pull requests and issues from the libraries, and details about repo-level issues that need to be addressed. We have a guide on [contributing to CircuitPython with Git and GitHub](https://learn.adafruit.com/contribute-to-circuitpython-with-git-and-github) if you need help getting started. You can also find us in the #circuitpython channels on the [Adafruit Discord](https://adafru.it/discord).

You can check out this [list of all the Adafruit CircuitPython libraries and drivers available](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_Bundle/blob/master/circuitpython_library_list.md). 

The current number of CircuitPython libraries is **###**!

## What’s the team up to this week?

What is the team up to this week? Let’s check in!

**Dan**

I've just added the ability to preserve the state of specified pins when entering deep sleep in CircuitPython. This is currently implemented on Espressif boards only.

I'm continuing to investigate and fix bugs for the 8.0.0 release.

**Kattni**

This week I published the [WiFi Mailbox Notifier guide](https://learn.adafruit.com/wifi-mailbox-notifier/overview)! This guide uses a CircuitPython, a Feather ESP32 V2, WiFi, and Adafruit IO to put together a project to install in your mailbox, that will email you every time the mailbox door is opened. The guide includes how to identify reed switch terminals (they can be very confusing!), soldering and assembly instructions, code walkthrough, Adafruit IO set up, installation and usage, and power analysis to verify your board is definitely entering deep sleep. The guide is great for the project, but also for the extra included info! Feel free to check it out!

**Melissa**

[![title](../assets/20220920/20220920melissa.gif)](url)

This past week I worked on adding a lot of improvements to the [CircuitPython Code Editor](https://code.circuitpython.org/). These improvements included some code restructuring, bug fixes, an improved loading animation with a spinning Blinka, folder uploading and downloading into a zipped file, updating to the latest CodeMirror editor component, changing the filename color based on whether changes are saved, and showing more files and details. I'm hoping to get this project to a good stopping point very soon and will probably be getting to some move thorough testing in about a week.

**Tim**

This week I worked on "finishing touches" for the flip clock widget library. The core functionality is done and working but I've been adding docstrings and type annotations as well as more thorough example scripts. The last piece remaining that needs cleanup, docstrings, and type annotations is the PIL based script that runs on the PC to generate the sprite sheets. Once that one is finished up I'll make the PR to add this library to the bundle.

**Jeff**

I published a new guide this week: [Commodore Keyboard to USB HID with CircuitPython](https://learn.adafruit.com/commodore-keyboard-to-usb-hid-with-circuitpython/overview) -- In this guide, you will learn how to adapt a matrix-style keyboard from an iconic computer brand to a modern computer using CircuitPython and the KB2040 board.

**Liz**

This past week I wrote a [guide on plugging the new nOOds flexible LED filaments into CV (control voltage) synths](https://learn.adafruit.com/noods-led-synth-cv-visualizers). The nOOds light up depending on the voltage and waveform coming out of your synth. I'm hoping this will inspire folks to get creative with these new LEDs. If you want more info on them, be sure to check out [Phil B's amazing 
Überguide](https://learn.adafruit.com/noods-uberguide) that he did for them.

I also added a [page to the MacroPad guide](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-macropad-rp2040/attaching-external-hardware) on using external hardware with the board, such as a STEMMA board. The MacroPad has a STEMMA port on the side so there's a lot of possibilities for adding sensors to your macro keyboard setup.
