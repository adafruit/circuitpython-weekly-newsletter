Welcome to the latest Python on Microcontrollers newsletter! We've reported that Microsoft has a renewed interest in Python and has even hired Guido van Rosum, the language's creator. Two steps this week to strengthen Microsoft's commitment in supporting Python with their .NET framework and the ability to programk in Linux on Wiondows. - *Ed.*

We're on [Discord](https://discord.gg/HYqvREz), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/search?q=circuitpython&src=typed_query&f=live), and for past newsletters - [view them all here](https://www.adafruitdaily.com/category/circuitpython/).

## Mu Editor Version 1.2.0 Released

[![Mu Editor](../assets/20221122/20221122mu.jpg)](https://github.com/mu-editor/mu/releases/tag/v1.2.0)

The Mu team has released a new version of the Mu Python Editor. This release introduces Snek mode, fixes some minor bugs, addresses some usability gremlins and adjusts some capabilities to make things tidier. Much of this work was done over the summer at the code-sprints at EuroPython 2022 in Dublin. It also includes the fix allowing for the CircuitPython 8 status line - [GitHub](https://github.com/mu-editor/mu/releases/tag/v1.2.0) and [Adafruit Blog](https://blog.adafruit.com/2022/11/15/mu-python-editor-version-1-2-0-released-today-mu-python/).

## Discount Shopping

[![Discount Shopping](../assets/20221122/20221122shop.jpg)](https://www.google.com/)

Traditionally, "Black Friday", the Friday after US Thanksgiving, started the holiday shopping season and brought discounts from sellers. In recent times, retailers have introduced sales prior to Black Friday. But it is still expected that there will be some of the best prices on items this week into the US weekend and into "Cyber Monday". This will include electronics companies selling microcontrollers and single board computers (if available). Check with your favorite retailers to see what they're planning.

## Please Send in Your Projects and Python News

Through the new year, folks will likely have some free time and it's a busy season for making projects. With the turmoil on social media, neat postings might be missed. Please send your links to internet posts to cpnews@adafruit.com for consideration of this newsletter. Thanks and we look forward to seeing all the submissions - *Ed.*

## CircuitPython Libraries!

[![CircuitPython Libraries](../assets/20221122/blinka.png)](https://circuitpython.org/libraries)

CircuitPython support for hardware continues to grow. We are adding support for new sensors and breakouts all the time, as well as improving on the drivers we already have. As we add more libraries and update current ones, you can keep up with all the changes right here!

For the latest libraries, download the [Adafruit CircuitPython Library Bundle](https://circuitpython.org/libraries). For the latest community contributed libraries, download the [CircuitPython Community Bundle](https://github.com/adafruit/CircuitPython_Community_Bundle/releases).

If you'd like to contribute, CircuitPython libraries are a great place to start. Have an idea for a new driver? File an issue on [CircuitPython](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/issues)! Have you written a library you'd like to make available? Submit it to the [CircuitPython Community Bundle](https://github.com/adafruit/CircuitPython_Community_Bundle). Interested in helping with current libraries? Check out the [CircuitPython.org Contributing page](https://circuitpython.org/contributing). We've included open pull requests and issues from the libraries, and details about repo-level issues that need to be addressed. We have a guide on [contributing to CircuitPython with Git and GitHub](https://learn.adafruit.com/contribute-to-circuitpython-with-git-and-github) if you need help getting started. You can also find us in the #circuitpython channels on the [Adafruit Discord](https://adafru.it/discord).

You can check out this [list of all the Adafruit CircuitPython libraries and drivers available](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_Bundle/blob/master/circuitpython_library_list.md). 

The current number of CircuitPython libraries is **393**!

**Updated Libraries!**

Here's this week's updated CircuitPython libraries:

* There are too many updated libraries to list this week! To view the list, check out the [Library Report](https://adafruit-circuit-python.s3.amazonaws.com/adabot/bin/reports/circuitpython_library_report_20221122.txt).

## What’s the team up to this week?

What is the team up to this week? Let’s check in!

**Dan**

Welcome back Scott! This week Scott, Jeff, and I met to triage the remaining 8.0.0 issues. I fixed several rather specific bugs: SAMD21 event channels were not being freed properly, STM PWMOut sometimes had incorrect clock speeds due to an off-by-one-bug, and RP2040 PinAlarms that triggered before a deep sleep could prevent wakeup. Right now I'm working on an Espressif SPI problem, and found and fixed a minor RP2040 SPI problem in the process.

**Kattni**

This week I published two guides: the PiCowbell Proto guide and a shorty guide for the Qwiik / STEMMA QT 5 port hub. 

The [PiCowbell guide](https://learn.adafruit.com/picowbell-proto) has detailed examples of the four ways to assemble it with a Pico, Pinouts details, as well as CircuitPython and Arduino I2C scan examples to ensure your STEMMA QT sensor or breakout is being recognised. It also has downloads resources if you'd like more information. If you picked up one of these handy little boards, check out this guide! 

The [STEMMA QT Hub guide](https://learn.adafruit.com/qwiik-stemma-qt-5-port-hub) has an overview, pinouts details, and a downloads resources page. It does not require code! If you're interested in the details of your new hub, check out this guide!

**Melissa**

This past week I focused on updating more of our Shell scripts over to Python. One of the reasons I had put this on hold was due to an elusive bug in the Adafruit_Python_Shell library's `run_command` function, which appeared to occasionally stop working. After diving in a bit deeper, I figured out a few situations where it wasn't working properly. After a few modifications, I finally had it working consistently and smoothly, so I resumed working on scripts.

**Tim**

This week I tested out some improvements to internal utilities in the led_animation library as well as a PR in the core to offload some of the heaviest work that occurs in those helpers to a core module in order to speed it up. I also started working on a change to the displayio API in the core that was proposed during the weekly meeting. 

**Jeff**

I have several prototype Adafruit PCBs and made pull requests to add them to CircuitPython: A new MatrixPortal with the ESP32-S2 microcontroller; and a pair of "reverse mount" TFT feathers in ESP32-S2 and ESP32-S3 variants. These Pull Requests will remain in draft form until the hardware is finalized, but from my testing things are in pretty good shape!

**Scott**

I'm back from twelve weeks of paternity/bonding leave. It was wonderful to bond with my kiddo and weird to be back working during the day. It's been awesome to see everything that has happened with CircuitPython while I'm out. I've gotten caught up on Discord, forums and e-mail. After chatting with Jeff and Dan, we've decided I'll start with Pico W web workflow. It is one of the major TODO items for 8.0.0. I'll also be testing code.circuitpython.org with that.

**Liz**

[High Power Infrared LED Emitter guide](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-high-power-infrared-led-emitter) is a fun board that lets you use a STEMMA JST-PH cable to quickly wire up an IR LED for things like TV-b-gones and remote controls.

The MicroLipo v2 was added to the [original MicroLipo and battery chargers guide](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-microlipo-and-minilipo-battery-chargers/overview). I added a pinouts page for the new MicroLipo v2 and updated the Charge Rate page since the MicroLipo v2 has a switch in place of a jumper to go between 100mA and 500mA charging rates.

The [QSPI breakout board guide](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-qspi-dip-breakout-boards) and [SPI flash guide](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-spi-flash-breakouts) do not have CircuitPython pages, since they're meant for Arduino use. However, the flash chips on the boards do have TOML definition files for CircuitPython, so they can be used in a board definition which some folks may find to be helpful.

## Upcoming events!
