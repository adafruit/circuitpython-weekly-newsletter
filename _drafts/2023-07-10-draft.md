The BBC has announced their new campaign, the BBC micro:bit - the next gen, to empower primary school children aged 8 to 11 to gain digital skills.

Each primary school in the UK can register to claim 30 micro:bits.  The campaign is sponsored by the Micro:bit Educational Foundation and Nominet, who made the donation possible.

Teachers will be able to access training on the micro:bit in person and online. - [BBC](https://www.bbc.co.uk/teach/microbit/register-free-microbit/zxrp3qt).

## IoT with Raspberry Pi Pico in Kenya

[![Rasperry Pi in Kenya](../assets/20230710/20230710pi-kenya.jpg)](https://www.raspberrypi.com/news/iot-with-raspberry-pi-pico-in-kenya/)

The Raspberry Pi Foundation provided free workshops in Kenya last month for the hardware community around Nairobi.  In partnership with Gearbox and Safaricom, they started with a Raspberry Pi Pico W and MicroPython.

The participants started by learning the basis of MicroPython and blinking an LED.  From there they moved to more advanced topics, including how to work with motion and proximity sensors, and environmental sensors.

Lastly, they connected the Raspberry Pi Pico W to the Internet and used Adafruit IO, Adafruit's cloud platform for IoT, to graph their data, set up alerts, and create dashboards. - [Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.com/news/iot-with-raspberry-pi-pico-in-kenya/)

PyScript has announced the Tech-Preview Release of the new PyScript core.  PyScript is a framework that allows users to create rich Python applications in the browser using HTML's interface and the power of Pyodide, WASM, and modern web technologies. Using MicroPython as the core, PyScript sees a massive size reduction with the core library being only 10kb compressed, a reduction of 98%, and improves speed and performance. - [Announcement on GitHub](https://github.com/pyscript/pyscript/discussions/1571).

## New Boards Supported by CircuitPython

The number of supported microcontrollers and Single Board Computers (SBC) grows every week. This section outlines which boards have been included in CircuitPython or added to [CircuitPython.org](https://circuitpython.org/).

This week, there were no new boards added!

*Note: For non-Adafruit boards, please use the support forums of the board manufacturer for assistance, as Adafruit does not have the hardware to assist in troubleshooting.*

Looking to add a new board to CircuitPython? It's highly encouraged! Adafruit has four guides to help you do so:

- [How to Add a New Board to CircuitPython](https://learn.adafruit.com/how-to-add-a-new-board-to-circuitpython/overview)

## What’s the CircuitPython team up to this week?

What is the team up to this week? Let’s check in!

**Dan**

I released CircuitPython 8.2.0 final on Wednesday, July 5. Thanks to everyone who brought it to fruition. Note that if you have an nRF52 board with an old bootloader, you will need to update the bootloader to be able to load CircuitPython 8.2.0. Bootloaders older than version 0.6.1 cannot handle the larger size of 8.2.0. See the [release notes](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/releases/tag/8.2.0) for details.

I did some Learn Guide revisions this and last week. I added [bootloader update pages](https://learn.adafruit.com/introducing-the-adafruit-nrf52840-feather/update-bootloader) for all nRF52 boards in preparation for the caveat mentioned above. And, with Carter's assistance, I added more detailed pages to all the Blinka-capable board guides explaining in more detail about "[Running CircuitPython Code without CircuitPython](https://learn.adafruit.com/circuitpython-on-raspberrypi-linux/running-circuitpython-code-without-circuitpython).

I'm continuing on the MicroPython merge.

[![Jeff](../assets/20230710/20230710jeff.gif)](https://www.circuitpython.org/)

With Scott's work for USB Host taking shape, one of the things we want to do is offer a "local" circuitpython workflow, in which you can edit your CircuitPython code without a computer attached. In this workflow, you need a display (such as `displayio` compatible TFT) and a keyboard (such as a USB keyboard connected to the Adafruit RP2040 USB Host Feather)

To that end, I've done some beginning work on implementing a full-screen editor in pure Python code. I found [a project by @seeM on github](https://github.com/seeM/editor) that I have [forked and adapted to CircuitPython], mostly by creating a very tiny subset of the standard "curses" library known as "dang". I also added a rudimentary file picker.

Integrating this, such as adding a way to switch between running and editing code, will be among the next steps.

**Scott**

I've been out for the long holiday weekend here in the US. Lots of lovely family time. I'm getting caught up and then diving back into USB host support. I'll be collaborating with Thach and Jeff on USB host support.

**Liz**

This week I published the [Ikea Vindriktning Hack guide](https://learn.adafruit.com/ikea-vindriktning-hack-with-qt-py-esp32-s3-and-adafruit-io). This guide walks you through adding a QT Py ESP32-S3 running CircuitPython to the Ikea Vindriktning air quality monitor to make it an IoT device. I also included pages on setting up a dashboard in Adafruit IO to visualize the data and creating alerts when the AQI starts to become unhealthy.
