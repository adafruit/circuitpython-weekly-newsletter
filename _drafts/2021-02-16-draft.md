## New Boards Supported by CircuitPython

The number of supported microcontrollers and Single Board Computers (SBC) grows every week. This section outlines which boards have been included in CircuitPython or added to [CircuitPython.org](https://circuitpython.org/).

This week we had X new boards added!

## CircuitPython Libraries!

[![CircuitPython Libraries](../assets/20210216/blinka.png)](https://circuitpython.org/libraries)

CircuitPython support for hardware continues to grow. We are adding support for new sensors and breakouts all the time, as well as improving on the drivers we already have. As we add more libraries and update current ones, you can keep up with all the changes right here!

For the latest libraries, download the [Adafruit CircuitPython Library Bundle](https://circuitpython.org/libraries). For the latest community contributed libraries, download the [CircuitPython Community Bundle](https://github.com/adafruit/CircuitPython_Community_Bundle/releases).

If you'd like to contribute, CircuitPython libraries are a great place to start. Have an idea for a new driver? File an issue on [CircuitPython](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/issues)! Have you written a library you'd like to make available? Submit it to the [CircuitPython Community Bundle](https://github.com/adafruit/CircuitPython_Community_Bundle). Interested in helping with current libraries? Check out the [CircuitPython.org Contributing page](https://circuitpython.org/contributing). We've included open pull requests and issues from the libraries, and details about repo-level issues that need to be addressed. We have a guide on [contributing to CircuitPython with Git and Github](https://learn.adafruit.com/contribute-to-circuitpython-with-git-and-github) if you need help getting started. You can also find us in the #circuitpython channel on the [Adafruit Discord](https://adafru.it/discord).

You can check out this [list of all the Adafruit CircuitPython libraries and drivers available](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_Bundle/blob/master/circuitpython_library_list.md).

## What’s the team up to this week?

What is the team up to this week? Let’s check in!

**Dan**

I released CircuitPython 6.2.0-beta.2, which has dozens of fixes and improvements, including fixes for some serious issues.

I fixed the `adafruit_sdcard` library to work properly with the new native `adafruit_bus_device` module. I've also been investigating I2C problems on the RP2040. One was a red herring, and the other seems peculiar to a particular sensor.

I'm continuing to work on the second USB serial channel for CircuitPython. Scott and I discussed and settled on the outlines of the Python API. There will probably be a `usb_cdc` module, with a fixed instance of the serial object, but with the flexibility to add more later.

**Jeff**

After taking a week off to read a book & work on my own projects, I'm back! I'm learning about the RP2040's "PIO" peripheral and with the help of community members I resolved a problem affecting neopixels on the Raspberry Pi Pico and other RP2040 boards. I also made a change to the tools that build the various "bundles", which should help circup by providing the "requirements.txt" files directly within the bundle; circup uses "requirements.txt" to decide what other libraries are needed to go with the requested library.

**Kattni**

This week I finalised the [new page](https://learn.adafruit.com/circuitpython-essentials/circuitpython-pins-and-modules) in the CircuitPython Essentials guide, and got it mirrored into every CircuitPython-compatible microcontroller guide. It covers using `import board` and `dir(board)` to tell CircuitPython where to look for the hardware you connected to your project, and how to learn about what pins and board objects are available for your microcontroller. It also explains how to find the built-in modules available for your board.

I published the [SHT40 guide](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-sht40-temperature-humidity-sensor) as well, which has everything you need to get started sensing temperature and humidity with this excellent sensor. I published the [ISO1540 guide] as well. I completed quite a bit of miscellaneous from my long to-do list. 

I'm currently working on the guide for the AW9523. It's nearly done, but needs some final touches. It should be live quite soon. I'm also adding at least one more example to the Getting Started with Raspberry Pi Pico and CircuitPython guide, which should also be available soon.

**Lucian**

This past week I fixed a number of internal errors in the Socket module, such as inconsistencies in internal types, connection failures for accepted sockets, and a multi-layered disconnection problem in the Requests library. I also resolved an issue with I2C not correctly sending a Repeated Start condition when requested. 

These issues required updates to my manual testing scripts, which have gradually accumulated over my time working on Circuitpython. Since many of these tests might be helpful to others doing reviews or trying to resolve their own issues, I'm working on a new manual tests directory to store and share them, along with associated documentation.

**Melissa**

This past week I worked on adding ESP32-S2 support to ESPHome. I had to get past a number of bugs. Unfortunately as I got closer to the end, I came to one that stopped me from progressing any further for the moment and that is WiFi refused to connect when I had I2C enabled. Even if I wasn't doing anything with it. I submitted a bug report to the package which I think is the culprit and I will be moving on to some other projects in the mean time.

**Scott**

This week I'm on the home stretch for audio playback with the RP2040. I got both single sample buffer and WaveFile playback with PWM audio. There is a pull request for it here: https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/pull/4167

I've begun work hooking up I2S which should be straightforward (fingers crossed.) Since we'll use the PIO for I2S, I'm also adding a few more APIs to the StateMachine class.

Once I'm out the audio weeds I'll be circling back to internal flash config with a possible detour to implement UART if no one has beat me to it.

Last night I also hacked a system to allow me to use my right hand on my keyboard for mouse clicks. I'm very happy with it so far. Tweet for it is here: https://twitter.com/tannewt/status/1359937799173021699

## Codecademy "Learn Hardware Programming with CircuitPython"

[![Codecademy CircuitPython](../assets/20210216/codecademy_python.png)](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-circuitpython?utm_source=adafruit&utm_medium=partners&utm_campaign=circuitplayground&utm_content=pythononhardwarenewsletter)

Codecademy, an online interactive learning platform used by more than 45 million people, has teamed up with the leading manufacturer in STEAM electronics, Adafruit Industries, to create a coding course, "Learn Hardware Programming with CircuitPython". The course is now available in the [Codecademy catalog](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-circuitpython?utm_source=adafruit&utm_medium=partners&utm_campaign=circuitplayground&utm_content=pythononhardwarenewsletter).

Python is a highly versatile, easy to learn programming language that a wide range of people, from visual effects artists in Hollywood to mission control at NASA, use to quickly solve problems. But you don’t need to be a rocket scientist to accomplish amazing things with it. This new course introduces programmers to Python by way of a microcontroller — CircuitPython — which is a Python-based programming language optimized for use on hardware.

CircuitPython’s hardware-ready design makes it easier than ever to program a variety of single-board computers, and this course gets you from no experience to working prototype faster than ever before. Codecademy’s interactive learning environment, combined with Adafruit's highly rated Circuit Playground Express, present aspiring hardware hackers with a never-before-seen opportunity to learn hardware programming seamlessly online.

Whether for those who are new to programming, or for those who want to expand their skill set to include physical computing, this course will have students getting familiar with Python and creating incredible projects along the way. By the end, students will have built their own bike lights, drum machine, and even a moisture detector that can tell when it's time to water a plant.
