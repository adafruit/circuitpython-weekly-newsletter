## Adafruit Update

[![Adafruit Heart New York](../assets/20200mdd/03312020heart.jpg)](https://blog.adafruit.com/2020/03/22/covid/)

Adafruit Industries continues to run with 100% of employees being paid and continuing to work. Most are working remotely, with some working in the Manhattan, New York factory as an essential service and business under NYC Executive Order 202.6 Capabilities. Adafruit was deemed an essential service to distribute/make some PPE (Personal Protection Equipment) such as face shields, and manufacturer electronics for essential life-saving/preserving equipment and development which is needed in New York and beyond. -[Blog](https://blog.adafruit.com/2020/03/22/covid/)

The CircuitPython team is going full steam ahead in development and rollout. We're expecting CircuitPython 5.1.0 to be stable and released soon and features for 5.2.x are being discussed. Would you like to join us? On Discord, head to https://adafru.it/discord to discuss things. And check out [Awesome CircuitPython](https://github.com/adafruit/awesome-circuitpython/blob/master/README.md) for a wide range of information.

## Made with Mu

Why Mu? Mu tries to make it as easy as possible to get started with programming but aims to help you graduate to "real" development tools soon after. Everything in Mu is the "real thing" but presented in as simple and obvious way possible. It's like the toddling stage in learning to walk: you're finding your feet and once you're confident, you should move on and explore! Put simply, Mu aims to foster autonomy. Try out Mu today! - [codewith.mu](https://codewith.mu/)

## Call for help – CircuitPython messaging to other languages!

[![Hello world](../assets/DIR-LOCATION/DATE-helloworld.jpg)](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/issues/1098)

We [recently posted on the Adafruit blog](https://blog.adafruit.com/2018/08/15/help-bring-circuitpython-messaging-to-other-languages-circuitpython/) about bringing CircuitPython messaging to other languages, one of the exciting features of CircuitPython 4 and later versions is translated control and error messages. Native language messages will help non-native English speakers understand what is happening in CircuitPython even though the Python keywords and APIs will still be in English. If you would like to help, [please post](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/issues/1098) to the main issue on GitHub and join us on [Discord](https://adafru.it/discord).

We made this graphic with translated text, we could use your help with that to make sure we got the text right, please check out the text in the image – if there is anything we did not get correct, please let us know. Dan sent me this [handy site too](http://helloworldcollection.de/#Human).
