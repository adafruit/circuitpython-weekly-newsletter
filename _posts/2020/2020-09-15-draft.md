## CircuitPython Milestones this week

[![150 CircuitPython Compatible Boards](../assets/20200915/20200915boards.jpg)](https://circuitpython.org/downloads)

[![50 CircuitPython Compatible Single Board Computers](../assets/20200915/20200915blinka50.jpg)](https://circuitpython.org/)

This past week, the CircuitPython community reached 150 microcontroller boards capable of running CircuitPython! - [CircuitPython.org](https://circuitpython.org/downloads)

In addition, over 50 single board computers (SBC) now run CircuitPython, including the Raspberry Pi, NeagleBone Black, nVidia Jetson and many more. With the Blinka library, users may use Python3 and make calls to CircuitPython functionality - [CircuitPython.org](https://circuitpython.org/blinka).

The number of supported microcontrollers and single board computers grows every week, and you can get your board added to the list! Adafruit has four guides to help you do so:

**PyPI Download Stats!**

We've written a special library called Adafruit Blinka that makes it possible to use CircuitPython Libraries on [Raspberry Pi and other compatible single-board computers](https://learn.adafruit.com/circuitpython-on-raspberrypi-linux/). Adafruit Blinka and all the CircuitPython libraries have been deployed to PyPI for super simple installation on Linux! Here are the top 10 CircuitPython libraries downloaded from PyPI in the last week, including the total downloads for those libraries:

Keep checking back for updated download stats coming soon!

## What’s the team up to this week?

What is the team up to this week? Let’s check in!

**Bryan**

With a feature complete version of the BNO080 library on the horizon, I’ve been primarily focused on getting the CircuitPython library complete and released. While I have been working on adding the final bunch of sensor reports, Ladyada was able to add UART support and further investigate why SPI isn’t working reliably. We’ve got some more hardware to test to get a final answer on that.

[![Bryan](../assets/20200915/20200915bryan.jpg)](https://circuitpython.org/)

One of the final report types that I added is a fun one: a motion classifier! This little bit of sensor fusion magic does its best to determine what type of activity is creating the motion that it is sensing, be it sitting on a desk, walking, running, in a vehicle(?!) and some others. I’m pretty sure they had to shrink down some PhDs and squeeze them into the sensor because that is pretty amazing.

Sometime not too long after releasing this library we’re going to write another version with many less bells and whistles that is super simple to use, thanks to a mode within the sensor that was added for robotic vacuum cleaners. So, if you think your SOCK_SHERLOCK_9000 missing sock locating robot needs an update to its heading and guidance system, keep an eye out for that library.

**Dan**

Both my HCI \_bleio work and Scott's ESP32S2 additions are now merged into the mainline of CircuitPython. There are some bugfix PR's still in progress; after they're finished I'll make a 6.0.0-beta.0 release.

I've been working on the Blinka \_bleio library. I verified it's still working on Windows and Linux. The MacOS version still needs work, and I've made significant progress on that. We're using the bleak library underneath, and the MacOS objects it uses are fairly different than what Windows and Linux present. Normally in bleak, you can just treat these objects as opaque boxes, but \_bleio exposes details that make it necessary to look at them in more detail. For instance, MacOS (and iOS) does not normally give you access to BLE addresses, for security reasons: instead you're just given a UUID. \_bleio expects that addresses are available, so I'll need to simulate this.

Our annual CircuitPython Day was last Wednesday, 9/9. A few days before, I decided to do a [beginner's introduction to CircuitPython as a live stream](https://youtu.be/1rkM0Ow8Pkc). It went well. I'm grateful to the Adafruit team members who helped run the stream, especially Pedro and Noe. The rest of the day was wonderful, and made me proud of what we have done and how far we've come in just a few years. It's a pleasure to work on something that is so fun and useful.

**Jeff**

My work with the CAN interface of the SAM series microcontrollers continues.  I have successfully transmitted packets from the SAM E54 Xplained dev board and received them on an STM32F405 Feather running Micropython.  I also have created a pull request that adds support for the SAM E51 series, because this chip (which supports CAN just like the E54) is likely to power an upcoming Adafruit board.

However, I'm most excited about progress in a personal project with CircuitPython: a port of standard Python's `decimal` library.  For efficiency, CircuitPython uses "single precision" floating point numbers which only have about 7 digits of precision (22 bits), and in binary floating point simple statements like ".1 + .2 = .3" are not necessarily true due to rounding.  With decimal, you can use as many digits as you need (up to the limits of RAM) and numbers that can be written as exact decimal numbers like ".1" are exact, instead of being rounded as they are in binary floating point.  This makes for calculations that are less surprising to users.  This library is on github and I plan to submit it to the community bundle.

Here, the unreasonably large number being displayed is the number 2 raised to the power 332.  In order to fit the size of screen I use, my calculator has 15 digits of precision and up to 2 digits of exponent.

[![Jeff](../assets/20200915/20200915jeff.jpg)](https://circuitpython.org/)

**Kattni**

I've been writing up guides for new products as we release them, and updating some older guides with CircuitPython usage and examples, as well as creating and endless supply of Fritzing objects for released and yet-to-be-released products. I've also filled extra time with miscellaneous that I keep around for that exact purpose.

This past week was CircuitPython Day. I ran a special edition of [Show and Tell in Español](https://youtu.be/V3q3RI5JL6E), hosted by Àlvaro Figueroa. Àlvaro did an amazing job. We live-streamed the [CircuitPython Weekly meeting](https://youtu.be/CsaqMtyZlak). Then, Jeff and I streamed a [CircuitPython Conversation](https://youtu.be/L4Bz_ztQew4) where we interviewed each other about some recent projects that we worked on. The stream went incredibly well (and that's coming from both of us expecting it to be a massive disaster). Finally, we all finished out the day on [Show and Tell](https://youtu.be/BGVP0vJlqvI) and [Ask an Engineer](https://youtu.be/JqK911g7O7Q), which became Ask All the CircuitPython Engineers. CircuitPython day turned out great, those watching seemed to enjoy it, and those participating seemed to have fun. Couldn't ask for more.

**Melissa**

[![Melissa](../assets/20200915/20200915melissa.jpg)](https://circuitpython.org/)

This past week I started with getting GPIO working on the STM32MP1 in Blinka. However, the way that this development board was intended to be used was for companies to create a custom version of Linux including compiling the device tree in order to get I2C, SPI, and UART working. This is beyond the scope of the average user and we decided to put it on hold until we can come up with something that's easier.

Next, I went and wrote up a quick demo for John Park's workshop that displayed a countdown until Halloween. This was a fun project and the only updates I needed to make to the MatrixPortal library were a couple of bug fixes.

I also started working on the Pixel Framebuf library. The purpose of the library it to make it easy for people to display text and shapes to a matrix of NeoPixels or Dotstars. This piggybacks on top of Kattni's LED Animation library and the existing framebuf library, which I extended to work with the RGB888 format so it can be used with NeoPixels.

**Scott**

This has been a short week because I took Friday and Monday off for a long weekend. Around that I iterated on the native wifi support for ESP32-S2 with Dan and just merged it!!! Next, I'm fixing SPI with the PSRAM. After that, I'll finish my changes to `adafruit_requests` to support the newer WiFi API alongside the older socket-like API.

CircuitPython Day was a blast as well with a number of [awesome streams](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLjF7R1fz_OOXqPXt-XCGZbGxkg5J17KyA).

## Codecademy "Learn Hardware Programming with CircuitPython"

[![Codecademy CircuitPython](../assets/20200915/codecademy_python.png)](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-circuitpython?utm_source=adafruit&utm_medium=partners&utm_campaign=circuitplayground&utm_content=pythononhardwarenewsletter)

Codecademy, an online interactive learning platform used by more than 45 million people, has teamed up with the leading manufacturer in STEAM electronics, Adafruit Industries, to create a coding course, "Learn Hardware Programming with CircuitPython". The course is now available in the [Codecademy catalog](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-circuitpython?utm_source=adafruit&utm_medium=partners&utm_campaign=circuitplayground&utm_content=pythononhardwarenewsletter).

Python is a highly versatile, easy to learn programming language that a wide range of people, from visual effects artists in Hollywood to mission control at NASA, use to quickly solve problems. But you don’t need to be a rocket scientist to accomplish amazing things with it. This new course introduces programmers to Python by way of a microcontroller — CircuitPython — which is a Python-based programming language optimized for use on hardware.

CircuitPython’s hardware-ready design makes it easier than ever to program a variety of single-board computers, and this course gets you from no experience to working prototype faster than ever before. Codecademy’s interactive learning environment, combined with Adafruit's highly rated Circuit Playground Express, present aspiring hardware hackers with a never-before-seen opportunity to learn hardware programming seamlessly online.

Whether for those who are new to programming, or for those who want to expand their skill set to include physical computing, this course will have students getting familiar with Python and creating incredible projects along the way. By the end, students will have built their own bike lights, drum machine, and even a moisture detector that can tell when it's time to water a plant.
