>_"[Wio Lite](https://www.seeedstudio.com/Wio-Lite-W600-p-4155.html) is a new product line from Seeed, and Wio Lite W600 is the first product in this series. Similar to the great Adafruit Feather series, the Wio Lite series is small in size and uniform in pins. Different performance and features are available when equipped with different processors and modules. Actually, Wio Lite is compatible with Feather board pins, we believe Feather is a very successful development platform in the community, and there are already many cool Feather boards out there from Adafruit. The Wio Lite aims at adding different wireless solutions to enrich the Feather community and provide more possibility for Feather users. On top of that, we’ve released the Grove Shield for Wio Lite at the same time. With this shield, we bring over 200 Grove sensors, actuators and displays to Wio Lite series and the Feather community."_

## Made with Mu - PyperCard

[![PyperCard](../assets/08132019/81319pypercard.jpg)](https://pypercard.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)

PyperCard - Easy GUIs for All - [pypercard.readthedocs.io](https://pypercard.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). PyperCard is a HyperCard inspired Pythonic GUI framework for beginner programmers. PyperCard makes it quick and easy to create software with a modern user interface to use on your Windows, OSX, Linux, Android or iOS devices. PyperCard was created in response to the work of the wonderful folks at Adafruit who designed a simple GUI library for one of their CircuitPython based devices. PyperCard takes Adafruit’s original concept, refines it and makes it available on a large number of computing platforms. To achieve this, PyperCard currently uses the Kivy UI framework under the hood.

Check it out! All in Mu!

Why Mu? Mu tries to make it as easy as possible to get started with programming but aims to help you graduate to "real" development tools soon after. Everything in Mu is the "real thing" but presented in as simple and obvious way possible. It's like the toddling stage in learning to walk: you're finding your feet and once you're confident, you should move on and explore! Put simply, Mu aims to foster autonomy. Try out Mu today! - [codewith.mu](https://codewith.mu/)

## Updated Guides - Now With More Python!

**You can use CircuitPython libraries on Raspberry Pi!** We're updating all of our CircuitPython guides to show how to wire up sensors to your Raspberry Pi, and load the necessary CircuitPython libraries to get going using them with Python. We'll be including the updates here so you can easily keep track of which sensors are ready to go. Check it out!

Keep checking back for more updated guides!

## CircuitPython Libraries!

[![CircuitPython Libraries](../assets/08132019/81319blinka.png)](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_Bundle/releases/latest)

CircuitPython support for hardware continues to grow. We are adding support for new sensors and breakouts all the time, as well as improving on the drivers we already have. As we add more libraries and update current ones, you can keep up with all the changes right here!

For the latest drivers, download the [Adafruit CircuitPython Library Bundle](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_Bundle/releases/latest).

If you'd like to contribute, CircuitPython libraries are a great place to start. Have an idea for a new driver? File an issue on [CircuitPython](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/issues)! Interested in helping with current libraries? Check out [this GitHub issue on CircuitPython](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/issues/1246) for an overview of the State of the CircuitPython Libraries, updated each week. We've included open issues from the library issue lists, and details about repo-level issues that need to be addressed. We have a guide on [contributing to CircuitPython with Git and Github](https://learn.adafruit.com/contribute-to-circuitpython-with-git-and-github) if you need help getting started. You can also find us in the #circuitpython channel on the [Adafruit Discord](https://adafru.it/discord). Feel free to contact Kattni (@kattni) with any questions.

You can check out this [list of all the CircuitPython libraries and drivers available](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_Bundle/blob/master/circuitpython_library_list.md). 

The current number of CircuitPython libraries is **171**!

## Call for help – CircuitPython messaging to other languages!

[![Hello world](../assets/08132019/81319hello.jpg)](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/issues/1098)

We [posted on the Adafruit blog](https://blog.adafruit.com/2018/08/15/help-bring-circuitpython-messaging-to-other-languages-circuitpython/) about bringing CircuitPython messaging to other languages, one of the exciting features of CircuitPython 4.x is translated control and error messages. Native language messages will help non-native English speakers understand what is happening in CircuitPython even though the Python keywords and APIs will still be in English. If you would like to help, [please post](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/issues/1098) to the main issue on GitHub and join us on [Discord](https://adafru.it/discord).

We made this graphic with translated text, we could use your help with that to make sure we got the text right, please check out the text in the image – if there is anything we did not get correct, please let us know. Dan sent me this [handy site too](http://helloworldcollection.de/#Human).
